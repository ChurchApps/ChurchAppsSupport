  Welcome to FreeShow!  This guide will walk you through creating your first presentation
  <break time="1s"/>
  To get started, simply open FreeShow and click Get Started
  <break time="1s"/>
  In the Projects pane, we will click the New Project button and give it a name of "Sunday Service"
  <break time="1s"/>
  Click on your project and we'll add a new Section
  <break time="1s"/>
  Sections help you keep your project organized
  <break time="1s"/>
  We'll call this section "Worship"
  <break time="1s"/>
  Let's add some worship song lyrics
  <break time="1s"/>
  Each song will be a "Show" within the project
  <break time="1s"/>
  Click on the 'Shows' tab at the bottom and then "New Show"
  <break time="1s"/>
  Type in the name of the song and click search
  <break time="1s"/>
  Select the song from the search results and lyrics will be loaded automatically
  <break time="1s"/>
  You can then select additional option such as the category for this show and how many lines of text per slide
  <break time="1s"/>
  Use templates to change the look of your presentation
  <break time="1s"/>
  We'll add a few more songs
  <break time="1s"/>
  Let's add another section for the sermon
  <break time="1s"/>
  We'll add a new show for the sermon notes which can be pasted in manually
  <break time="1s"/>
  For offering time lets add a new show category of Other
  <break time="1s"/>
  Then add a new empty Show called "Offering Time"
  <break time="1s"/>
  Let's add a new slide to it
  <break time="1s"/>
  Then we can add a background image by going to the Media tab
  <break time="1s"/>
  We could select an image on our computer or use the Online tab to search for one
  <break time="1s"/>
  Simply drag the image to the edit box
  <break time="1s"/>
  Change the fit from Contain to cover
  <break time="1s"/>
  Now we can add a label by going to Items and selecting the Textbox item
  <break time="1s"/>
  We'll type "Offering Time" <break time="500ms"/> but that's hard to read
  <break time="1s"/>
  Lets change the text color to black
  <break time="1s"/>
  Then auto-size the text
  <break time="1s"/>
  And resize and position the textbox to our liking
  <break time="1s"/>
  Go back to the Show tab and you can preview your entire project by clicking the arrow keys
