# Scheduling Lessons from Lessons.church

B1 Admin integrates directly with [Lessons.church](https://lessons.church) so you can schedule curriculum for your classrooms right inside your service plans. This keeps everything — volunteers, assignments, and lesson content — in one place.

## Step 1 — Link Your Lessons.church Account

Before you can browse and schedule lessons, you need to connect your Lessons.church account to your ministry in B1 Admin. This is a one-time setup.

1. Log in to [B1 Admin](https://admin.b1.church/) and go to **Serving**
2. Open the ministry you want to connect (e.g., Children's Ministry)
3. Scroll down to the **Content Provider Accounts** section
4. Click **Link New Provider**
5. Select **Lessons.church** from the list
6. A device authorization flow will start — you'll see a code on screen
7. Go to [lessons.church](https://lessons.church), log in, and enter the code to authorize the connection
8. Once approved, you'll see **"Account linked"** under Lessons.church in B1 Admin

> **Note:** You must have an active Lessons.church account before linking. If your church doesn't have one yet, sign up at [lessons.church](https://lessons.church) first.

## Step 2 — Schedule a Lesson

Once your Lessons.church account is linked, you can schedule lessons directly from Plans.

1. In B1 Admin, go to **Serving → Plans**
2. Click the button to add a new plan — the **Schedule Lesson** form opens
3. Select the **date** for the lesson (defaults to the upcoming Sunday)
4. Click **Select Lesson** — a content browser dialog opens
5. At the top of the dialog, make sure **Lessons.church** is selected as the provider
6. Browse through the content hierarchy:
   - Select a **Program** (e.g., "Bible Stories for Kids")
   - Select a **Study** within that program (e.g., "Creation and Early Stories")
   - Select the specific **Lesson**
   - Select the **Venue** — this is the age-group version of the lesson (e.g., "Preschool", "Elementary"). **Make sure you pick the right venue for your classroom's age group.**
7. Click **Associate Lesson** to confirm your selection
8. Back on the Schedule Lesson form, choose your **copy option**:
   - **Nothing** — creates a fresh plan with no volunteers copied
   - **Positions Only** — copies volunteer roles from the previous plan but not who's assigned
   - **Positions and Assignments** — copies both roles and assigned volunteers (most common choice)
9. Click **Save**

The plan will be created and named automatically (e.g., "Feb 23 - Elementary"). Your volunteers can now open the plan to see their assignments and review the lesson content before Sunday.

## Tips

- **Plan ahead** — You can schedule multiple weeks of lessons at once. Your volunteers will be able to see upcoming lessons and prepare in advance.
- **Check your venue** — Choosing the wrong venue (e.g., scheduling the Preschool version for an Elementary class) means your volunteers will see content for the wrong age group.
- **Copy assignments** — Using "Positions and Assignments" saves time each week by carrying over your regular volunteer team to the new plan. You only need to make changes when someone is unavailable.
