   Export your Data From Breeze you will need 3 files for this. Do not skip any of these files, you have to have all 3 to complete the process. You will need People, Tags, and Contributions. Export each of these .xlsx files separately. To get here, on your Breeze account from the dashboard go to 'settings' and then to 'manage accounts"

2. Next put those three files into a zip file.
   On a Mac: Highlight those 3 files and then right-click or control-click on them and choose Compress. This will make a file named Archive. Save it somewhere on your computer where you know where it is.
   On a PC: Press and hold (or right-click) the three files, select (or point to) Send to, and then select Compressed (zipped) folder. A new zipped folder with the same name is created in the same location.
