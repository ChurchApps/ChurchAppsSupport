## Admin work after payments start coming in.

Click on "edit" in profile and you can change the e-mail to whatever you choose.
  You can also follow [these](https://support.stripe.com/questions/change-the-email-addresses-where-stripe-emails-are-sent#:~:text=If%20you%20want%20account%2Drelated,Stripe%20to%20other%20email%20addresses) instructions to forward notifications to whoever you would like.

**Member Donation Memos**

When members make donations through your B1 church portal, they can now include memos with their gifts to specify the purpose of their donation. These memos will appear in your donation records and reports, helping you track designated gifts even when specific funds aren't set up. For more information on how members can add memos, see [Member Donations](/b1/portal/donations/).

**Donation summary**

Gives a weekly summary of giving in graph form.
Download: Gives a csv with the total amount given, the week it was given and what fund it was given to.
This summary does not tell who gave.
You can filter the report by date. The top date should be the earlier date and the bottom date the most recent date.

**Batches**

This is a report of who gave, when they gave, how much they gave and to what fund.
Download: Gives a csv with the number of donations, the id, the name and the total amount given.
Click on “name” this opens a window with a breakdown of how many times the person donated and how much each time.
Click on “ID” and it opens a side window with a discription of that donation.
Download: Gives a csv with all the information in the data base about that donor and how much they gave.
