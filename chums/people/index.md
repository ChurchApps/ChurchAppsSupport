## People vs Users
People and users are similar, but they are different.  A 'Person' represents data a church is tracking about an individual regardless of whether they use any of the applications.  A 'User' is someone who can log into a ChurchApps application.  

A user record can be associated with a single person record on each church, but not all people will have users records tied to them.  Likewise, if a single user is active with multiple churches, they could have a different associated person record for each church.  Person data is never shared between churches.

If the validated email address a user has logged in with matches the email address on a person record, the two will automatically be linked the next time a person logs in.

## Permission Notes
In order to edit people you need to be in a role with Edit People permission.  To view Attendance and Donations you need the View Attendance and View Donations permissions.  To edit custom fields, you will need Edit Forms permission.

## Adding People to Chums
If you have the edit permission you can add new people by first searching for them, then at the bottom of the search result enter their first and last name and click 'Add'.

## Attendance and Donations
With the appropriate permissions, you can view attendance and donation details from the person details page.  However data cannot be editted from this page.  You will need to go to the Attendance or Donations tabs on the main navigation to edit the data.
