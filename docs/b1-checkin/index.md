# B1 Church Checkin Overview

<div class="article-intro">

B1 Church Checkin is a self-service kiosk app for Android tablets. It lets church members look up their family, assign children to groups or classes, and print name labels and parent pickup slips -- all without needing a volunteer at the desk.

## How It Works

Place an Android tablet in your lobby or welcome area. Members walk up, search for their household by phone number or last name, review their family, choose which groups each person should attend, and tap **Check-in**. The app prints name labels and pickup slips automatically, then resets for the next family.

## Key Features

- **Self-service member lookup** -- Search by phone number or last name to find your household quickly.
- **Household review** -- See all family members with photos and current group assignments at a glance.
- **Group assignment** -- Assign each family member to the right class or group for the selected service time.
- **Guest check-in** -- Add a guest to your household on the spot with a first and last name.
- **Label printing** -- Print name labels for children and parent pickup slips with unique security codes.
- **Network printer support** -- Discover and configure network printers directly from the app.
- **Auto-login** -- After the first login, the app remembers your credentials and goes straight to the services screen on future launches.
- **Multi-church support** -- If your account is linked to more than one church, you can choose which one to check into.
- **Church branding** -- The app displays your church logo in the header once a church is selected.
