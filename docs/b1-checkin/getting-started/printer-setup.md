# Printer Setup

<div class="article-intro">

B1 Church Checkin can print name labels and parent pickup slips to a network label printer. Setting up the printer is optional -- you can use the app without a printer for attendance tracking only.

</div>

<div class="prereqs">
<h4>Before You Begin</h4>

- [Log in](./logging-in) to the B1 Church Checkin app and select your church
- Connect a compatible network label printer to the same Wi-Fi network as the tablet

</div>

## Accessing Printer Settings

You can open the printer settings screen at any time by tapping the **printer status bar** at the very top of the screen. This thin bar shows the app version number and the current printer connection status.

## Scanning for Printers

When the printer settings screen opens, the app automatically scans your local network for compatible printers. You will see a loading indicator with the message "Scanning for printers" while the scan is in progress.

Once the scan completes, you will see a list of discovered printers. Each printer card shows:

- The **printer model** name
- The **IP address** of the printer on your network

A **No Printer** option is always included at the bottom of the list.

:::warning
The tablet and the printer must be connected to the same local network for the scan to discover the printer. If your printer does not appear, verify that both devices are on the same Wi-Fi network and that the printer is powered on.
:::

## Selecting a Printer

1. Tap the printer you want to use. The selected printer card becomes highlighted with a checkmark.
2. To print without a physical printer (for testing or attendance-only mode), select **No Printer**.

## Test Printing

Before saving your selection, you can verify the connection works:

1. Select a printer from the list.
2. Tap the **Test Print** button at the bottom of the screen.
3. The app sends a test label to the printer. If the printer is connected properly, a test page will print.

If you tap **Test Print** with **No Printer** selected, the app will display an alert reminding you that no printer is selected.

:::tip
Always run a test print after selecting a printer to confirm the connection before your next service.
:::

## Saving Your Selection

When you are satisfied with your printer choice:

1. Tap the **Save & Restart** button at the bottom of the screen.
2. The app saves your printer selection and restarts to apply the settings.

Your printer selection is remembered across app restarts. You do not need to set it up again unless you want to change printers.

:::info
If you move the kiosk to a different location or change your network setup, return to the printer settings to scan for printers again and update your selection.

## Next Steps

With your printer configured, you are ready to start checking in. See the [check-in workflow](../check-in/) to learn how the full process works, starting with [selecting a service](../check-in/selecting-service).
