# Getting Started with B1 Church Checkin

Setting up B1 Church Checkin takes just a few minutes. You need an Android tablet, a ChurchApps account, and optionally a network label printer.

## What You Need

- **An Android tablet** -- A 10-inch tablet works best for the kiosk experience.
- **A ChurchApps account** -- The email and password you use for B1 Admin or other ChurchApps products.
- **A network label printer** (optional) -- For printing name labels and parent pickup slips. The app can scan your local network to find compatible printers.

## Installation

1. Open the **Google Play Store** on your Android tablet.
2. Search for **B1 Church Checkin**.
3. Tap **Install** and wait for the download to finish.
4. Open the app. You will see a splash screen while it initializes.

## First-Time Setup

When you launch the app for the first time, you will go through three steps:

1. **[Log in](./logging-in)** -- Enter your email and password to authenticate.
2. **[Select your church](./logging-in)** -- If your account is linked to multiple churches, choose which one this kiosk should serve.
3. **[Set up a printer](./printer-setup)** -- Configure a network printer for label printing, or skip this step if you do not need labels.

After the first login, the app saves your credentials and church selection. On future launches, it will skip straight to the services screen automatically.

The app checks for over-the-air updates each time it starts. If an update is available, it downloads and applies automatically before you reach the login screen.
