# Logging In

<div class="article-intro">

Before the kiosk can be used for check-in, you need to sign in with a ChurchApps account that has access to your church. This page covers the first-time login process, church selection, auto-login behavior, and how to log out.

</div>

<div class="prereqs">
<h4>Before You Begin</h4>

- Install B1 Church Checkin on your Android tablet (see [Getting Started](./index.md))
- Have your ChurchApps account email and password ready

</div>

## First-Time Login

1. Open the B1 Church Checkin app. After the splash screen, you will see the login screen with the B1 Church Checkin logo.
2. Enter your **email address** in the first field.
3. Enter your **password** in the second field.
4. Tap the **Login** button.

The app validates your credentials and signs you in. If the email or password is incorrect, you will see an error message at the bottom of the screen.

:::info
This is the same email and password you use for B1 Admin or any other ChurchApps product. You do not need a separate account for the check-in kiosk.
:::

## Selecting Your Church

After a successful login, the app loads a list of churches linked to your account. Each church is displayed as a card showing the church name and logo (if one has been configured in B1 Admin).

- If your account is linked to **only one church**, you will still see the selection screen. Tap your church to continue.
- If your account is linked to **multiple churches**, tap the church you want this kiosk to serve.

Once you select a church, the app loads that church's branding and appearance settings. Your church logo will appear in the header on all subsequent screens.

## Auto-Login on Return Visits

The app saves your email, password, and selected church after the first successful login. On future launches:

- The app automatically logs in with your saved credentials.
- If you previously selected a church, it restores that selection and takes you directly to the **services screen**.
- If the saved credentials are no longer valid, the app returns to the login screen so you can sign in again.

:::tip
Because the kiosk auto-logs in, you only need to enter credentials once during initial setup. After that, the tablet can be powered on and it will be ready to go.
:::

## Logging Out

Logging out is intentionally hidden so that church members using the kiosk cannot accidentally sign out. To log out:

1. Tap the **church logo** in the header **seven times** in quick succession (within two seconds).
2. A confirmation dialog will appear asking if you want to log out.
3. Tap **Logout** to confirm, or **Cancel** to stay signed in.

This clears your saved credentials and returns you to the login screen.

:::warning
Logging out clears all saved credentials and church selection. You will need to re-enter your email and password to use the kiosk again. Only log out when you need to switch accounts or reconfigure the kiosk.

## Next Steps

Once logged in, you can [set up a printer](./printer-setup) or go directly to the [check-in workflow](../check-in/).
