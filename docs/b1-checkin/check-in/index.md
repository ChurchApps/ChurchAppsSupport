# Check-In Workflow

<div class="article-intro">

The check-in process in B1 Church Checkin follows a simple, step-by-step flow. A church member walks up to the kiosk, finds their family, confirms group assignments, and checks in -- all in under a minute. This section covers each step of the kiosk check-in experience.

</div>

## The Check-In Flow at a Glance

1. **[Select a service](./selecting-service)** -- Choose which service you are attending (e.g., Sunday AM, Sunday PM, Midweek).
2. **[Look up your family](./looking-up-members)** -- Search by phone number or last name to find yourself in the system.
3. **[Review your household](./household-review)** -- See all family members and their current group assignments.
4. **[Assign groups](./group-assignment)** -- Choose which class or group each family member should attend for each service time.
5. **[Add guests](./adding-guests)** (optional) -- Add a visitor to your household if they are joining you.
6. **[Complete check-in](./completing-checkin)** -- Tap the check-in button to submit attendance and print labels.

After check-in is complete, the app displays a success screen and automatically returns to the lookup screen, ready for the next family.

:::tip
The entire flow is designed for church members to use independently. Volunteers do not need to operate the kiosk, though having someone nearby to help first-time visitors is always a good idea.

## Before You Begin

Make sure the following are configured in B1 Admin before using the check-in kiosk:

- **Services and service times** are set up under Attendance settings. See the [attendance setup guide](../../b1-admin/attendance/setup.md).
- **Groups** are created and linked to the appropriate service times. See [creating groups](../../b1-admin/groups/creating-groups.md).
- **Group settings** are configured for label printing: enable **Print Nametag** for groups that need name labels, and **Parent Pickup** for children's groups that need pickup slips.
- **People** are added to the system with household associations. See [adding people](../../b1-admin/people/adding-people.md).

:::info
If you have not yet set up the kiosk itself, see [Getting Started](../getting-started/) for installation, login, and printer configuration instructions.
