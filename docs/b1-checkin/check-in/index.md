# Check-In Workflow

The check-in process in B1 Church Checkin follows a simple, step-by-step flow. A church member walks up to the kiosk, finds their family, confirms group assignments, and checks in -- all in under a minute.

## The Check-In Flow at a Glance

1. **[Select a service](./selecting-service)** -- Choose which service you are attending (e.g., Sunday AM, Sunday PM, Midweek).
2. **[Look up your family](./looking-up-members)** -- Search by phone number or last name to find yourself in the system.
3. **[Review your household](./household-review)** -- See all family members and their current group assignments.
4. **[Assign groups](./group-assignment)** -- Choose which class or group each family member should attend for each service time.
5. **[Add guests](./adding-guests)** (optional) -- Add a visitor to your household if they are joining you.
6. **[Complete check-in](./completing-checkin)** -- Tap the check-in button to submit attendance and print labels.

After check-in is complete, the app displays a success screen and automatically returns to the lookup screen, ready for the next family.

The entire flow is designed for church members to use independently. Volunteers do not need to operate the kiosk, though having someone nearby to help first-time visitors is always a good idea.

## Before You Begin

Make sure the following are configured in B1 Admin before using the check-in kiosk:

- **Services and service times** are set up under Attendance settings.
- **Groups** are created and linked to the appropriate service times.
- **Group settings** are configured for label printing: enable **Print Nametag** for groups that need name labels, and **Parent Pickup** for children's groups that need pickup slips.
