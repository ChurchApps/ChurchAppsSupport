# Adding Guests

<div class="article-intro">

If someone is visiting your family and needs to check in with your household, you can add them as a guest directly from the kiosk. This is useful for visiting children, relatives, or friends who are not yet in the church system.

</div>

<div class="prereqs">
<h4>Before You Begin</h4>

- [Look up your family](./looking-up-members) and select a member from the search results
- Be on the [household review screen](./household-review) where you can see your family members

</div>

## How to Add a Guest

1. From the **household review screen**, tap the **Add Guest** button located below the list of household members.
2. The add guest form appears with two fields:
   - **First Name** -- Enter the guest's first name.
   - **Last Name** -- Enter the guest's last name.
3. Tap the **Add Guest** button to save.

The guest is added to your household and you are returned to the household review screen. The new guest will appear in your member list alongside your other family members.

:::info
If the guest's name matches someone already in the system who is not a member, the app will link to that existing record instead of creating a duplicate. This helps keep your church database clean.

## After Adding a Guest

Once the guest appears in your household list, you can:

- **Expand their card** and [assign them to a group](./group-assignment), just like any other family member.
- **[Check in](./completing-checkin)** the entire household including the guest.

## Canceling

If you change your mind, tap the **Cancel** button at the bottom of the add guest form to return to the household review screen without adding anyone.

:::tip
Adding a guest at the kiosk creates a person record in your church's database. Your church administrator can update the guest's full details later in B1 Admin under [People](../../b1-admin/people/adding-people.md).

## Next Step

After adding guests and [assigning groups](./group-assignment) as needed, you are ready to [complete check-in](./completing-checkin).
