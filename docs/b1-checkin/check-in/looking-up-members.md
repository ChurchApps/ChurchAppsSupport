# Looking Up Members

<div class="article-intro">

After selecting a service, you arrive at the member lookup screen. This is where you search for your family so you can check in. The app supports searching by phone number or by name.

</div>

<div class="prereqs">
<h4>Before You Begin</h4>

- [Select a service](./selecting-service) from the services screen
- Ensure your household has been [added to the system](../../b1-admin/people/adding-people.md) by a church administrator

</div>

## Search Modes

The lookup screen offers two search modes. You can switch between them by tapping the toggle at the top of the screen:

- **Phone** -- Search by phone number. This is the default mode.
- **Name** -- Search by name.

## Searching by Phone Number

1. Make sure **Phone** is the active search mode (it is highlighted at the top).
2. Tap the search field and enter at least **4 digits** of your phone number using the on-screen keypad.
3. Tap the **Search** button or press the search key on the keyboard.

The app searches for members whose phone number matches the digits you entered. If you enter more than 4 digits, it uses the full number. If you enter exactly 4, it matches against the last 4 digits of phone numbers on file.

## Searching by Name

1. Tap the **Name** toggle at the top of the screen to switch to name search mode.
2. Enter at least **2 characters** of the person's name in the search field.
3. Tap the **Search** button.

The app searches for members whose name matches what you typed.

## Selecting a Person

Search results appear as cards below the search field. Each card shows the person's **name** and **photo** (if one is on file).

Tap a person's card to select them. The app loads all members of that person's household and takes you to the [household review screen](./household-review).

:::tip
Searching by the last 4 digits of a phone number is the fastest way to look up your family. Encourage members to use this method for a quicker check-in experience.
:::

:::warning
If no results are found, the app displays a message letting you know. Double-check the digits or name you entered, or try the other search mode. If you are a first-time visitor, ask a volunteer for help getting [added to the system](../../b1-admin/people/adding-people.md).

## Next Step

After selecting a person, you will [review your household](./household-review) and manage group assignments.
