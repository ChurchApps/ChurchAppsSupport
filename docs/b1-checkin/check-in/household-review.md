# Reviewing Your Household

After you select a person from the search results, the app loads your entire household and displays it on the household review screen. This is where you can see everyone in your family and manage their group assignments before checking in.

## Viewing Household Members

Each household member appears as a card with:

- Their **photo** (or a placeholder icon if no photo is on file)
- Their **display name**
- A **summary of their current group assignments** (shown as small chips below the name when the card is collapsed)
- An **expand/collapse arrow** on the right side

## Expanding a Member

Tap a member's card to expand it. When expanded, you will see a row for each **service time** within the selected service. Each row shows:

- The **service time name** (for example, "9:00 AM" or "11:00 AM")
- A **button** showing the currently assigned group, or "Select Group" if no group has been assigned yet

Tap the group button to go to the [group selection screen](./group-assignment) where you can choose or change the group for that person and service time.

Tap the member's card again to collapse it.

:::tip
You do not need to assign every family member to a group. Adults who are attending the main worship service can be left without a group assignment. Only assign groups for members who need to be checked into a specific class or program.

## Navigating from This Screen

From the household review screen, you have three options:

- **Expand a member** and tap a service time button to [assign or change a group](./group-assignment).
- **Tap the Add Guest button** below the member list to [add a guest](./adding-guests) to your household.
- **Tap the Check-in button** at the bottom of the screen to [complete the check-in](./completing-checkin) for everyone in the household.

:::info
Any group assignments from a previous check-in to the same service are pre-loaded automatically. If your children attend the same groups each week, you may not need to change anything -- just review and check in.
