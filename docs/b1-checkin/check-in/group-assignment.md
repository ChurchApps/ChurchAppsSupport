# Assigning Groups

When you tap a service time button on the household review screen, the app opens the group selection screen. Here you choose which group or class a family member should attend for that specific service time.

## How Groups Are Organized

Groups are displayed in **categories**. Each category appears as a card showing:

- The **category name** (for example, "Children", "Youth", "Adults")
- The **number of groups** in that category

Tap a category card to expand it and see the individual groups inside. Tap it again to collapse it.

## Selecting a Group

1. Tap a **category** to expand it.
2. Review the list of groups within that category. Each group shows its name with a selection icon on the right.
3. Tap the **group name** you want to assign.

The app saves your selection and returns you to the household review screen. The service time button for that member will now show the name of the group you selected.

## Choosing "None"

If you decide that a family member should not be assigned to any group for this service time, tap the **None** button at the bottom of the screen. This clears any existing group assignment for that service time and returns you to the household review screen.

:::tip
Use the **None** option for adults who attend the main worship service and do not need to check into a specific group or class.

## Changing a Group Assignment

To change a group assignment that has already been made:

1. Go back to the household review screen.
2. Expand the member whose group you want to change.
3. Tap the service time button (which now shows the currently assigned group name).
4. Select a different group or tap **None**.

:::note
Groups and categories are configured by your church administrator in B1 Admin. If a group is missing or in the wrong category, ask your admin to update the group settings.
