# Assigning Groups

<div class="article-intro">

When you tap a service time button on the household review screen, the app opens the group selection screen. Here you choose which group or class a family member should attend for that specific service time.

</div>

<div class="prereqs">
<h4>Before You Begin</h4>

- [Review your household](./household-review) on the household review screen
- Expand the member you want to assign and tap a service time button
- Ensure your church administrator has [created groups](../../b1-admin/groups/creating-groups.md) and linked them to service times in B1 Admin

</div>

## How Groups Are Organized

Groups are displayed in **categories**. Each category appears as a card showing:

- The **category name** (for example, "Children", "Youth", "Adults")
- The **number of groups** in that category

Tap a category card to expand it and see the individual groups inside. Tap it again to collapse it.

## Selecting a Group

1. Tap a **category** to expand it.
2. Review the list of groups within that category. Each group shows its name with a selection icon on the right.
3. Tap the **group name** you want to assign.

The app saves your selection and returns you to the [household review screen](./household-review). The service time button for that member will now show the name of the group you selected.

## Choosing "None"

If you decide that a family member should not be assigned to any group for this service time, tap the **None** button at the bottom of the screen. This clears any existing group assignment for that service time and returns you to the household review screen.

:::tip
Use the **None** option for adults who attend the main worship service and do not need to check into a specific group or class.

## Changing a Group Assignment

To change a group assignment that has already been made:

1. Go back to the [household review screen](./household-review).
2. Expand the member whose group you want to change.
3. Tap the service time button (which now shows the currently assigned group name).
4. Select a different group or tap **None**.

:::info
Groups and categories are configured by your church administrator in B1 Admin. If a group is missing or in the wrong category, ask your admin to update the [group settings](../../b1-admin/groups/creating-groups.md).

## Next Steps

After assigning groups, return to the [household review screen](./household-review) to:

- Assign groups to additional family members
- [Add a guest](./adding-guests) if someone is visiting with your family
- [Complete check-in](./completing-checkin) when all assignments are ready
