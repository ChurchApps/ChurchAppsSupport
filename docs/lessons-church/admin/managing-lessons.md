# Managing Lessons

Lessons are the individual teaching sessions within a study. Each lesson represents what happens during a single class meeting. This is where you build out the detailed content that volunteers will use when they teach.

## Creating a Lesson

1. Navigate to the **Admin** area, expand the program and study, and find the study you want to add a lesson to.
2. Click **Add Lesson**.
3. Enter a **Name** and other details for the lesson.
4. Save the lesson.

## Understanding the Lesson Structure

Each lesson is organized into several layers:

- **Venues** -- Different versions of the lesson for different age groups or settings. For example, you might have a "Preschool" venue and an "Elementary" venue for the same lesson.
- **Sections** -- The segments within a venue, such as "Welcome", "Video", "Bible Story", and "Activity". Sections control the flow of the class time.
- **Roles and Actions** -- Within each section, you assign roles (for example, "Lead Teacher" or "Small Group Leader") and give each role specific actions.

## Action Types

There are four types of actions you can assign to a role within a section:

- **Say** -- text the volunteer should speak or paraphrase to the class.
- **Do** -- a physical activity or instruction to carry out.
- **Note** -- background information or a reminder for the volunteer (not read aloud).
- **Play** -- a video or audio clip to play during the section.

## Adding a Venue

1. Open the lesson in the admin view.
2. Click **Add Venue**.
3. Enter a name for the venue (e.g., "Preschool" or "Elementary").
4. Save. You can now add sections to this venue.

## Adding Sections and Actions

1. Expand a venue to see its sections.
2. Click **Add Section** and give it a name (e.g., "Welcome").
3. Within the section, click **Add Action**.
4. Choose the **role**, **action type** (Say, Do, Note, or Play), and enter the content.
5. Save.

Repeat this process to build out the full lesson flow.

## Uploading Lesson-Level Resources

You can attach downloadable materials directly to a lesson -- for example, an activity sheet or coloring page specific to that week.

1. Open the lesson in the admin view.
2. Navigate to the **Resources** section.
3. Upload your files.

:::tip
Build your lesson from the volunteer's perspective. Step through the sections and actions in order and ask yourself whether a first-time volunteer could follow along without any other preparation.
