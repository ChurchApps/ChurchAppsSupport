# Managing Studies

<div class="article-intro">

A study is a series of related lessons within a program. For example, a four-week series called "The Good Samaritan" would be a study inside a larger children's ministry program. This guide covers creating, editing, and organizing studies in the admin area.

<h4>Before You Begin</h4>

## Creating a Study

1. Navigate to the **Admin** area and expand the program you want to add a study to.
2. Click **Add Study**.
3. Fill in the following fields:
   - **Name** -- The display name for the study (e.g., "The Good Samaritan").
   - **Slug** -- A URL-friendly identifier (e.g., "the-good-samaritan").
   - **Description** -- A summary of what this study covers and how many lessons it includes.
   - **Image** -- Upload a thumbnail image for the study.
4. Save the study.

## Editing a Study

1. Click on the study name in the admin list.
2. Update any of the fields as needed.
3. Save your changes.

## Assigning a Category

If the parent program uses study categories, you can assign your study to one:

1. Open the study in the admin view.
2. Select a **Category** from the dropdown.
3. Save.

Categories help users browse programs that have many studies. For example, you might have categories like "Old Testament", "New Testament", and "Topical".

## Managing Lessons Within a Study

Studies contain one or more lessons. Expand a study in the admin view to see its lessons, or click **Add Lesson** to create a new one. See [Managing Lessons](./managing-lessons.md) for details on building out lesson content.

## Uploading Study-Level Resources

You can attach downloadable files that apply to the entire study -- for example, a series overview, promotional graphics, or a parent newsletter template.

1. Open the study in the admin view.
2. Navigate to the **Resources** section.
3. Upload your files.

:::tip
Write your study description with church leaders in mind. A clear summary of the theme, target age group, and number of lessons helps churches decide whether to use the series.
