# Statistics

The statistics page gives admins insight into how their content is being used. You can see which studies are most popular, which churches are downloading your resources, and where those churches are located.

## Accessing Statistics

1. Navigate to the **Admin** area.
2. Select the **Stats** or **Statistics** page.
3. Choose the **program** you want to view statistics for.

## What You Can See

The statistics page provides several views of your download data:

### Downloads by Study

A breakdown of unique downloads for each study within the selected program. This shows you which series are getting the most traction and helps you decide where to invest your content creation efforts.

### Church List

A list of churches that have downloaded resources from your program. This gives you a sense of your audience and how widely your content is being adopted.

### Geographic Distribution

A map view showing where your downloading churches are located. This helps you understand the geographic reach of your curriculum and identify regions where your content is popular.

### Date Range Filtering

You can filter all statistics by a date range to focus on a specific time period. This is useful for seeing trends over time or measuring the impact of a newly released study.

1. Set the **start date** and **end date** using the date pickers.
2. The statistics will update to reflect only the activity within that range.

## Using Statistics Effectively

Here are a few ways to put your download data to work:

- **Identify popular content** -- Focus your effort on creating more material in the style and topics that get the most downloads.
- **Track new releases** -- After publishing a new study, filter by date to see how quickly it is being picked up.
- **Understand your audience** -- Use the church list and map to see who is using your content and consider reaching out to those communities.

Statistics are based on unique downloads. If the same church downloads a resource multiple times, it is counted once.
