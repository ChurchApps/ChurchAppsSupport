# Administration

<div class="article-intro">

The admin area in Lessons.church is where content creators and administrators manage the lesson library. From here you can build out your curriculum structure, upload resources, review usage statistics, and connect third-party content providers.

:::warning
Admin access requires appropriate permissions. If you do not see the admin options, contact your church administrator to request access.

## What You Can Do

The admin area gives you full control over your content:

- **Create and edit programs** -- Set up top-level curriculum series with names, descriptions, images, and slugs.
- **Manage studies** -- Organize groups of related lessons within each program.
- **Build lessons** -- Add individual lessons with venues, sections, roles, and actions.
- **Upload resources** -- Attach downloadable files (PDFs, activity sheets, images) at the program, study, or lesson level.
- **View statistics** -- See which content is being downloaded, by whom, and where.
- **Configure providers** -- Connect external curriculum providers that use the Open Lesson Format.

## Content Hierarchy

As an admin, it helps to understand how content is structured:

1. **Programs** contain one or more studies.
2. **Studies** contain one or more lessons.
3. **Lessons** contain one or more venues (age-group variations).
4. **Venues** contain sections, and sections contain role-based actions.

Each level can have its own downloadable resources attached.
