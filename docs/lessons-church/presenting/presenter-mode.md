# Presenter Mode

Presenter Mode turns a lesson into a full-screen, projection-friendly display. It is designed for showing lesson content on classroom screens, projectors, or TVs so that everyone in the room can follow along.

## Entering Presenter Mode

1. Open the lesson you want to present.
2. Click the **Present** button on the lesson page.
3. The lesson will switch to a full-screen view with a black background and large, easy-to-read text.

Once you are in Presenter Mode, you can move through the lesson section by section using the on-screen navigation controls.

## What It Looks Like

Presenter Mode uses a clean, dark background so the content stands out on a projected screen. Each section of the lesson is displayed one at a time, keeping the focus on the current activity. Text, images, and video embeds are all formatted to be readable from across a room.

## Using with FreeShow

Lessons.church integrates with [FreeShow](https://freeshow.app), a free presentation application. FreeShow can pull lesson content directly from Lessons.church, allowing you to incorporate lesson slides into your existing presentation workflow. This is especially useful if you already use FreeShow for worship lyrics or announcements.

## Using with Venue TV App

The **Venue TV** Android app lets you display lessons on a TV without a separate computer. Install the app on an Android TV device, connect it to your Lessons.church classroom, and the scheduled lesson will appear automatically. This is a great hands-free option for classrooms that have a dedicated screen.

:::tip
If you are using a projector, make sure your display is set to mirror or extend to the projector before entering Presenter Mode. This ensures the full-screen view appears on the correct screen.

## Exiting Presenter Mode

To leave Presenter Mode, press the **Escape** key or click the exit button in the corner of the screen. You will return to the normal lesson view.
