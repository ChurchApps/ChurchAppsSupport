# Downloads and Materials

<div class="article-intro">

Lessons on Lessons.church come with downloadable resources that you can print or share digitally. These materials support the lesson content and give your volunteers and students something tangible to work with during and after class.

## Types of Materials

Depending on the lesson and provider, you may find resources such as:

- **Activity sheets** -- Hands-on worksheets for students to complete during class.
- **Coloring pages** -- Printable pages for younger age groups.
- **Leader guides** -- Detailed instructions and background information for teachers.
- **Supplementary PDFs** -- Additional reading, take-home sheets, or parent handouts.

Not every lesson includes all of these. The available materials depend on what the content provider has supplied.

## Where to Find Downloads

Resources are available at three levels:

- **Program level** -- General resources that apply to the entire curriculum series.
- **Study level** -- Materials tied to a specific study within a program.
- **Lesson level** -- Resources for an individual lesson.

To download materials:

1. Navigate to the lesson, study, or program page.
2. Look for the **Downloads** or **Resources** section on the page.
3. Click on a file name to download it to your device.

Files are typically in PDF format and ready to print.

## Preparing for Class

A good routine is to check for downloadable materials a few days before class:

1. Open the upcoming lesson and review the available downloads.
2. Print enough copies of activity sheets and coloring pages for your expected attendance.
3. Review the leader guide so you are familiar with the lesson flow.
4. Set aside any take-home materials to hand out at the end of class.

:::info
Some providers include all of their materials at the study level rather than attaching them to individual lessons. If you do not see downloads on a specific lesson page, check the parent study or program page.

:::tip
Create a weekly checklist for your volunteers that includes downloading and printing materials. This ensures nothing is forgotten before Sunday morning.
