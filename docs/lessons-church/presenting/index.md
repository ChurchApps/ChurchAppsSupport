# Presenting

Lessons.church provides tools to help your volunteers confidently teach each lesson. Whether you are projecting content on a screen, handing out printed guides, or distributing activity sheets, everything you need is built right into the platform.

## Presenter Mode

When it is time to teach, you can launch **Presenter Mode** directly from any lesson. This gives you a full-screen, projection-friendly view designed for classroom screens and projectors. It also integrates with FreeShow presentation software and the Venue TV Android app for automated displays.

## Volunteer Guides

Each lesson includes role-based guides so your volunteers know exactly what to say and do. A greeter sees their instructions, a small-group leader sees theirs, and so on. Guides can be viewed on a phone or tablet during class, or printed ahead of time.

## Downloadable Materials

Lessons come with downloadable resources such as activity sheets, coloring pages, leader guides, and supplementary PDFs. These materials are available at the program, study, and lesson levels, so you can grab everything you need in one place.

## Putting It All Together

A typical Sunday morning workflow might look like this:

1. Download and print any activity sheets or coloring pages earlier in the week.
2. Share the volunteer guide links with your team so they can review their roles.
3. Open the lesson in **Presenter Mode** on the classroom computer or TV.
4. Walk through the lesson sections while volunteers follow along with their individual guides.
