# Classrooms

Classrooms are the foundation of how you organize teaching at your church in Lessons.church. A classroom represents a physical or virtual room where lessons are taught -- for example, "Preschool Room," "Elementary K-2," or "Adult Bible Study."

## Why Classrooms Matter

When you set up classrooms, you create a clear structure for your children's ministry, youth groups, or any teaching environment. Each classroom gets its own schedule, so your volunteers always know exactly what to teach and when. Instead of passing around paper schedules or sending last-minute emails, everyone can check the portal to see what is coming up.

## What You Can Do with Classrooms

- **Create unlimited classrooms** -- Set up as many classrooms as your church needs. There is no limit, so you can have separate classrooms for every age group, campus, or program.
- **Schedule lessons** -- Assign specific lessons to each classroom on specific dates. Your schedule shows both past and upcoming lessons at a glance.
- **Customize content** -- Tailor lesson content for each classroom so volunteers only see what is relevant to their age group.

## How Classrooms Fit Together

Classrooms connect the lesson content on Lessons.church to your church's real-world teaching schedule. Here is the typical workflow:

1. Browse the available programs and studies on Lessons.church.
2. Set up your classrooms to match your church's rooms and age groups.
3. Schedule lessons to each classroom for upcoming dates.
4. Volunteers open their classroom to see what is scheduled and prepare.
