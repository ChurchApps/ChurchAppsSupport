# Setting Up Classrooms

Before you can schedule lessons, you need to create classrooms that represent your teaching environments. This guide walks you through the process.

## Creating a Classroom

1. Log in to your account at [Lessons.church](https://lessons.church).
2. Navigate to your **Portal**. This is your church's central hub for managing classrooms and schedules.
3. Click **Add Classroom**.
4. Enter a name for your classroom. Choose something descriptive that your volunteers will recognize -- for example, "Preschool," "Elementary K-2," or "Middle School."
5. Save your new classroom. It will appear on your portal dashboard right away.

Repeat these steps for each room or age group at your church. You can create as many classrooms as you need.

## First-Time Setup

If you have not set up any classrooms yet, your portal will display a setup video to guide you through the process. This video covers the basics of creating classrooms and scheduling your first lessons. It is a great starting point if you are new to Lessons.church.

:::tip
Name your classrooms to match how your volunteers already think about your rooms. If everyone calls it "the Pre-K room," name it "Pre-K" rather than something formal like "Early Childhood Education Room 101."

## Managing Classrooms

Your classrooms appear on the portal dashboard where you can manage them at any time. From here you can:

- **Rename a classroom** -- Update the name if your rooms or age groups change.
- **Remove a classroom** -- Delete classrooms you no longer need.
- **View the schedule** -- Click on any classroom to see its lesson schedule.

## What's Next

Once your classrooms are set up, you are ready to start [scheduling lessons](./scheduling-lessons) so your volunteers know what to teach each week.
