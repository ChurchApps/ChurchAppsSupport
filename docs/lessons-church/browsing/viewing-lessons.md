# Viewing Lessons

Each lesson on Lessons.church is a complete teaching session with structured content, downloadable materials, and support for multiple age groups. Here is how to navigate and use a lesson page.

## Getting to a Lesson

To view a lesson, navigate through the content hierarchy:

1. Click a **program** on the home page.
2. Select a **study** from the program page.
3. Click the **lesson** you want to view from the study page.

## What You Will See

The lesson page is organized into several areas:

### Video

If the lesson includes a video, it appears at the top of the page. Click to play it directly in your browser. Videos are often used as the main teaching segment, especially for children's ministry.

### Sections and Roles

Each lesson is divided into **sections** (for example, "Opening," "Bible Story," "Activity," "Closing"). Within each section, content is organized by **role**:

- **Leader** -- The primary teacher or presenter
- **Helper** -- Supporting volunteers
- Other custom roles the curriculum creator has defined

Each role lists its **actions**, which tell the volunteer exactly what to do:

- **Say** -- Script or talking points to read aloud
- **Do** -- Physical instructions or activities to perform
- **Note** -- Background information or tips for the volunteer
- **Play** -- Cues to play a video or audio clip

### Downloadable Materials

Lessons may include files you can download and print, such as:

- PDF handouts
- Activity sheets
- Coloring pages
- Craft instructions
- Take-home sheets for parents

Look for download links within the lesson page to access these resources.

## Switching Between Venues

Many lessons support multiple **venues**, which represent different age groups such as Preschool, Elementary, or Pre-Teen. Venues allow the same lesson topic to be tailored to the appropriate level for each group.

To switch between venues:

1. Look for the **venue selector** on the lesson page.
2. Click a different venue name (for example, switch from **Elementary** to **Preschool**).
3. The page updates to show the content, scripts, and materials designed for that age group.

:::tip
If you teach multiple age groups, review each venue before your session so you can see how the content is adapted for different levels.
