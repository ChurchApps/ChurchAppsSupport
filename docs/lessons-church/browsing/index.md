# Browsing Content

Lessons.church offers a free library of church curriculum that anyone can explore. You do not need an account or login to browse the available content -- just visit the site and start looking around.

## The Home Page

When you first arrive at Lessons.church, the home page gives you a quick overview of everything available:

- **Featured programs** -- Highlighted curriculum series appear at the top, making it easy to discover popular or recently updated content.
- **All programs** -- Below the featured section, you will find a complete listing of every available curriculum program along with statistics such as the number of lessons and studies in each.
- **Provider content** -- Content from both Lessons.church and external curriculum providers is displayed together, giving you a single place to explore.

## Ways to Find Content

There are several ways to navigate the curriculum library:

1. **Browse by program** -- Click any program on the home page to see its studies and lessons. This is the best approach when you want to explore a specific curriculum series. See [Programs and Studies](./programs-and-studies) for details.

2. **Search** -- Use the search page to find lessons by keyword across the entire library. This is helpful when you know a topic but are not sure which program covers it. See [Searching](./searching) for details.

3. **Explore external providers** -- Some content comes from third-party curriculum providers who publish in the Open Lesson Format. You can browse their programs and studies just like built-in content. See [External Providers](./external-providers) for details.

## No Login Required

Browsing is completely open. You can view programs, studies, lessons, downloadable materials, and videos without creating an account. If you decide you want to schedule lessons for your classrooms or customize content, you can create a free account at that point.
