# Programs and Studies

All curriculum on Lessons.church is organized in a clear hierarchy. Understanding this structure will help you find the right content for your church quickly.

## Content Hierarchy

Content is organized from broadest to most specific:

- **Provider** -- The organization that publishes the curriculum (Lessons.church or a third-party provider).
- **Program** -- A curriculum series, such as "Ark Kids" or "NextLevel." Each program is a collection of related studies designed around a theme or age group.
- **Study** -- A unit within a program, such as "The Good Samaritan." Each study contains a set of lessons that are meant to be taught together, often over several weeks.
- **Lesson** -- An individual teaching session within a study. Each lesson includes sections, roles, actions, and downloadable materials.
- **Venue** -- An age-group version of a lesson, such as Preschool or Elementary. Venues let you tailor the same lesson to different audiences.

## Browsing Programs

To explore programs:

1. Visit the Lessons.church home page.
2. Scroll through the list of available programs or look at the featured programs at the top.
3. Click on a **program name** or its image to open the program page.

Each program page includes:

- **Description** -- An overview of what the curriculum covers and who it is designed for.
- **Program image** -- A visual identity for the series.
- **Video trailer** -- Some programs include a short video preview so you can see the style and quality of the content before committing to it.
- **Studies** -- A listing of all studies in the program, which may be organized into categories.

## Browsing Studies

From a program page:

1. Browse the list of studies. If the program organizes studies into categories, you will see them grouped accordingly.
2. Click on a **study name** to open the study page.
3. The study page displays all of the lessons included in that study, listed in teaching order.

From here, you can click into any lesson to see its full content, including sections, roles, and downloadable materials. See [Viewing Lessons](./viewing-lessons) for a detailed walkthrough.
