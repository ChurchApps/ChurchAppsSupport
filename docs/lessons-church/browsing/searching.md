# Searching

<div class="article-intro">

When you know what topic you want to teach but are not sure which program or study contains it, the search feature helps you find the right content quickly. Search works across the entire Lessons.church library, including content from external providers.

<h4>Before You Begin</h4>

- Familiarize yourself with the [Browsing Content](./index.md) overview to understand all available navigation options

## How to Search

1. Navigate to the **search page** from the top of the Lessons.church site.
2. Type a keyword or phrase into the **search box** (for example, "forgiveness," "David and Goliath," or "prayer").
3. Press **Enter** or click the search button to see your results.

## How Search Works

Search is powered by full-text search across the entire Lessons.church library. It looks through lesson titles, descriptions, and content to find matches for your keywords. Results include lessons from all available programs and providers, so you get a comprehensive view of what is available on a given topic.

## Navigating Results

Search results display the matching lessons along with information about which program and study each one belongs to. Click on any result to go directly to that lesson page, where you can view the full content, sections, roles, and downloadable materials.

## When to Use Search

Search is most useful when:

- You have a specific Bible story or topic in mind and want to see all available curriculum that covers it.
- You are planning a special series and need to find lessons on a particular theme.
- You are not yet familiar with the available programs and want a quick way to explore what is offered.

:::tip
If your keyword returns too many results, try a more specific phrase. For example, search for "Good Samaritan" instead of just "Samaritan" to narrow things down.

If you already know which program you want, browsing by program is usually faster. See [Programs and Studies](./programs-and-studies.md) for details on navigating the content hierarchy.
