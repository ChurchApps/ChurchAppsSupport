# Customizing Lessons

<div class="article-intro">

This guide walks you through customizing a lesson for your classroom. Customizations let you remove, hide, or reorder content so your volunteers see exactly what they need -- nothing more, nothing less.

</div>

<div class="prereqs">
<h4>Before You Begin</h4>

- [Set up at least one classroom](../classrooms/setting-up-classrooms.md) in the portal
- [Schedule a lesson](../classrooms/scheduling-lessons.md) to the classroom you want to customize
- Read the [Customization overview](./index.md) to understand what can be customized

</div>

## Opening the Customization View

1. Log in and navigate to your **Portal**.
2. Select the **classroom** that has the lesson you want to customize.
3. Click on the **scheduled lesson** to open it.
4. Click **Customize** to enter the customization view.

You will see the full lesson content broken down into sections, roles, and actions.

## Removing Sections

If a section does not apply to your classroom, you can remove it entirely. This is useful when a lesson includes content for multiple age groups and you only need one. For example, if a lesson has both a "Preschool Activity" and an "Elementary Activity" section, you can remove whichever one does not fit your room.

1. Find the section you want to remove.
2. Click to **remove** or **hide** the section.
3. The section will no longer appear for volunteers viewing this lesson.

## Hiding Roles or Actions

Within a section, you can hide specific roles or actions. For instance, if a section includes a "Worship Leader" role but your classroom does not have one, you can hide just that role without removing the entire section.

1. Expand the section to see its roles and actions.
2. Click to **hide** any role or action you do not need.

## Reordering Content

You can rearrange sections and actions to match the flow you prefer:

1. Drag sections or actions to move them up or down in the order.
2. The new order is what your volunteers will see when they view the lesson.

## Saving Your Customization

When you are done making changes, save the customization. You will be asked to choose how it applies:

- **This classroom only** -- The changes apply to just the current classroom. Other classrooms are unaffected.
- **All classrooms** -- The changes apply across every classroom at your church.
- **Remove customization** -- If you previously customized this lesson and want to go back to the original content, choose this option to clear your changes.

:::tip
Start by customizing a single lesson for one classroom. Once you are comfortable with the process, you can apply customizations more broadly across all classrooms.

## When to Customize

Customization is most useful when:

- A lesson has content for multiple age groups and you want to show only the relevant parts.
- Your classroom does not use certain roles (like a dedicated worship leader or tech volunteer).
- You prefer a different order for the lesson flow than what is provided by default.

:::info
You do not need to customize every lesson. If the content works as-is for your classroom, you can skip this step entirely and go straight to [presenting](../presenting/index.md).
