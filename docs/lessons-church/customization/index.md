# Customization

Lessons.church provides a library of ready-to-use lesson content, but every church is different. The customization features let you tailor lesson content to fit your specific classrooms, teaching style, and age groups.

## Why Customize?

Lesson content on Lessons.church is designed to be flexible. A single lesson might include sections for multiple age groups, optional activities, or roles that do not apply to every classroom. Instead of asking your volunteers to mentally skip over parts that do not apply, you can customize the lesson so they only see what is relevant to them.

For example, a lesson might include a craft activity that works great for preschoolers but is not a good fit for your fifth-grade classroom. With customization, you can hide that section for the older group while keeping it for the younger one.

## What You Can Customize

- **Remove sections** -- Hide entire sections of a lesson that do not apply to a specific classroom or age group.
- **Hide roles or actions** -- Remove individual roles or actions within a section if they are not needed.
- **Reorder content** -- Rearrange sections and actions to match the flow you prefer for your classroom.

## Classroom-Specific or Global

When you save a customization, you choose how broadly it applies:

- **Single classroom** -- The customization only affects the current classroom. Other classrooms see the original content.
- **All classrooms** -- The customization applies across every classroom at your church.

This flexibility means you can set up different views of the same lesson for different age groups, or make a change that applies everywhere at once.
