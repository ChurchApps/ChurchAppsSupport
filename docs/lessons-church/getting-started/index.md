# Getting Started

<div class="article-intro">

Lessons.church is completely free to use. There are no subscriptions, no trial periods, and no feature limits. This section walks you through creating your account, connecting your church, and navigating the portal so you can start scheduling lessons right away.

</div>

## What You Need

To get started with Lessons.church, you will:

1. **Create an account** -- Register at [Lessons.church](https://lessons.church) with your name, email, and a password. This uses the same ChurchApps account you may already have from B1.church.
2. **Connect your church** -- After registering, connect to your existing church profile or create a new one. This links your classrooms and schedules to your church.
3. **Set up classrooms** -- Create classrooms that match your ministry (for example, "Preschool", "1st-3rd Grade", or "Youth"). Classrooms are where you schedule and organize lessons.
4. **Start scheduling lessons** -- Browse the content library, find a study that fits your needs, and schedule lessons to your classrooms.

Once your classrooms are set up and lessons are scheduled, your volunteers can access the content through the portal and present lessons to their classes.

If you already have a ChurchApps account from B1.church, you can log in to Lessons.church with the same credentials -- no need to register again.
