# Portal Overview

<div class="article-intro">

After logging in to Lessons.church, you are taken to the **Portal** -- your church's dashboard for managing classrooms and lesson schedules. This is where you will spend most of your time when organizing curriculum for your church.

</div>

<div class="prereqs">
<h4>Before You Begin</h4>

- [Create an account](./creating-account.md) and connect to your church
- Log in to [Lessons.church](https://lessons.church)

</div>

## What You See

The portal is organized into two main areas:

- **Classrooms** (right side) -- A list of your church's classrooms. Click a classroom name to view its scheduled lessons. You can also add new classrooms or edit existing ones from here.
- **Scheduled Lessons** (left side) -- Once you select a classroom, this area displays the lessons that have been scheduled for it. If you have not set up any classrooms yet, you will see a setup instructions video to help you get started.

## What You Can Do from the Portal

From the portal, you can:

1. **Manage classrooms** -- Add, edit, or remove classrooms. Each classroom can be linked to a volunteer team (so they see upcoming lessons in the B1 app) and a parent/student group (so they can access recent lessons).
2. **View and manage scheduled lessons** -- See which lessons are coming up for each classroom and make changes as needed.
3. **Subscribe to classroom feeds** -- Click the feed icon next to a classroom to get a playlist feed URL you can use with compatible apps.
4. **Access External Providers** -- Use the **External Providers** page to configure third-party content sources that support the Open Lesson Format. This lets you bring in lessons from other providers beyond the built-in Lessons.church library.
5. **Access the Admin area** -- If you have admin permissions, you will see an **Admin** option in the navigation. The admin area lets you manage programs, studies, and lessons at a content level.

## Navigation

The portal navigation includes:

- **Home** -- Return to the public Lessons.church home page to browse content.
- **Schedules** -- The main portal view for managing classrooms and lesson schedules.
- **External Providers** -- Configure third-party lesson providers.
- **Admin** -- Manage programs, studies, and lesson content (visible only if you have admin permissions).

:::info
The **Admin** option only appears if your account has been granted content editing permissions. Most church staff will use the **Schedules** and **External Providers** pages for day-to-day management.

## Getting Started

If you are visiting the portal for the first time and have not created any classrooms yet, start by clicking **Add First Classroom** in the classrooms panel. Give your classroom a name (for example, "Preschool" or "3rd-5th Grade") and save it. From there, you can begin [scheduling lessons](../classrooms/scheduling-lessons.md).
