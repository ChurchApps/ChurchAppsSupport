# Timeline

<div class="article-intro">

The **Timeline** is the default landing page of your B1.church member portal. It provides an activity feed showing the latest updates from your groups and church, keeping everything in one convenient place.

</div>

<div class="prereqs">
<h4>Before You Begin</h4>

- You must be [logged in](../getting-started/logging-in.md) to your B1.church account.

</div>

## What the Timeline Shows

The timeline displays a feed of posts and updates, which may include:

- **Group conversations** -- Messages and discussions from [groups](../groups/) you belong to.
- **Tasks** -- Tasks assigned to you or your groups.
- **Events** -- Upcoming events relevant to you and your groups.
- **Lessons** -- Curriculum and [lesson content](../content/lessons.md) shared with your groups.
- **Sermons** -- Recent [sermons](../content/sermons.md) posted by your church.

Each post in the feed shows the post title, the group it belongs to (if applicable), and how long ago it was posted.

## Viewing Post Details

The timeline uses a master-detail layout. Your feed is listed on the left side of the page. Click on any post to open its full details in the panel on the right. From the detail view, you can read the complete content of the post and interact with it.

Click **Back to updates** at the top of the detail panel to return to the feed list.

## Staying Connected

The timeline pulls together activity from across all of your groups into a single feed, so you do not need to check each group individually. It is a good habit to visit your timeline regularly to stay informed about what is happening at your church.

:::tip
If your timeline is empty, you may not be a member of any groups yet. Visit the [Groups](../groups/browsing-groups.md) page to find groups to join, or ask your church administrator or group leader to add you.
