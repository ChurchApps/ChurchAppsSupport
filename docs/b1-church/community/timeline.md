# Timeline

The **Timeline** is the default landing page of your B1.church member portal. When you navigate to your member area, you are taken to the timeline automatically. It provides an activity feed showing the latest updates from your groups and church.

## What the Timeline Shows

The timeline displays a feed of posts and updates, which may include:

- **Group conversations** -- Messages and discussions from groups you belong to.
- **Tasks** -- Tasks assigned to you or your groups.
- **Events** -- Upcoming events relevant to you and your groups.
- **Lessons** -- Curriculum and lesson content shared with your groups.
- **Sermons** -- Recent sermons posted by your church.

Each post in the feed shows the post title, the group it belongs to (if applicable), and how long ago it was posted.

## Viewing Post Details

The timeline uses a master-detail layout. Your feed is listed on the left side of the page. Click on any post to open its full details in the panel on the right. From the detail view, you can read the complete content of the post and interact with it.

Click **Back to updates** at the top of the detail panel to return to the feed list.

## Staying Connected

The timeline pulls together activity from across all of your groups into a single feed, so you do not need to check each group individually. It is a good habit to visit your timeline regularly to stay informed about what is happening at your church.

:::tip
If your timeline is empty, you may not be a member of any groups yet. Ask your church administrator or group leader to add you, and updates will start appearing in your feed.
