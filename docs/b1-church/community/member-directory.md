# Member Directory

<div class="article-intro">

The member directory lets you browse and search for people in your church. Whether you need to look up a fellow group member or find someone new, the directory makes it easy to connect with your church family.

</div>

<div class="prereqs">
<h4>Before You Begin</h4>

- You must be [logged in](../getting-started/logging-in.md) to your B1.church account.

</div>

## Accessing the Directory

1. Click **Community** in the [sidebar navigation](../getting-started/navigating.md).
2. The directory loads with a list of all visible church members on the left side of the page.

## Searching for Members

The page uses a master-detail layout. On the left side, you have two ways to find people:

### Search by Name

1. Make sure the **People** filter is selected at the top of the search area.
2. Type a name into the search box.
3. Click **Search** or press **Enter** to see results.

If you leave the search box empty and click **Search**, the full directory listing is shown.

### Search by Group

1. Click the **Groups** filter at the top of the search area.
2. Select a group from the dropdown list.
3. Click **Search** to see all members of that group.

:::tip
Searching by group is a quick way to find someone you met at a [group meeting](../groups/browsing-groups.md) but whose name you cannot quite remember.

## Browsing the Directory

Members are listed alphabetically by last name and grouped under letter headings (A, B, C, and so on). Each entry shows the member's photo, display name, and household name, making it easy to scan through the list.

## Viewing a Member Profile

Click on any member in the list to open their profile in the detail panel on the right. The profile shows the member's information as configured by your church, which may include contact details, household members, and group memberships.

You can click on household members within a profile to navigate to their profiles as well.

:::info
The information visible in each profile depends on your church's privacy and directory settings. Not all fields may be shown for every member.
