# Community

The **Community** section in B1.church helps you stay connected with your church family. It brings together a member directory for finding and learning about fellow church members, and a timeline feed that keeps you up to date with what is happening in your groups and church.

## What You Will Find

- **[Member Directory](./member-directory)** -- Browse and search your church's member directory. Look up people by name or filter by group to find who you are looking for. Click on a member to view their profile details.
- **[Timeline](./timeline)** -- Your activity feed showing the latest updates from your groups and church. The timeline is the default landing page when you visit the member portal.

## Getting Started

You must be logged in to access community features. If you are not signed in, you will be prompted to log in when you navigate to the **Community** tab or the **Timeline**.

The **Timeline** tab is always available in the sidebar and serves as the home page of your member portal. The **Community** tab provides access to the member directory.

:::info
The members and information visible to you in the directory depend on your church's privacy settings. You may not be able to see every member's full profile. If you have questions about what is shared, contact your church administrator.
