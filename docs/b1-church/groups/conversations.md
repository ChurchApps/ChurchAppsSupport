# Group Conversations

<div class="article-intro">

The Conversations tab on your group page is a space where group members can post messages and interact with each other. Use conversations to discuss topics, share updates, and stay connected with your group between meetings.

</div>

<div class="prereqs">
<h4>Before You Begin</h4>

- You must be [logged in](../getting-started/logging-in.md) to your B1.church account.
- You must be a member of the group to access the Conversations tab. See [Group Details](./group-details.md) for how to join a group.

</div>

## Accessing Conversations

1. Navigate to the group detail page by clicking on a group from the [groups page](./browsing-groups.md).
2. Make sure you are logged in.
3. Click the **Conversations** tab in the sidebar.

## Discussions and Announcements

The Conversations tab may show two sub-tabs:

- **Discussions** -- A space where any group member can post messages and reply to others. This is the default view and is always available.
- **Announcements** -- Messages posted by group leaders that are important for all members to see. Regular members can read announcements but only leaders can create them.

If there are no announcements and you are not a leader, you will only see the Discussions view without the tab bar.

## Posting a Message

1. Open the **Conversations** tab on your group page.
2. Make sure you are on the **Discussions** sub-tab (if the tab bar is visible).
3. Type your message in the text field.
4. Submit your message to share it with the group.

Your message will be visible to all members of the group.

:::tip
Group conversations also appear on your [Timeline](../community/timeline.md), so you can keep up with discussions without visiting each group individually.

## Leader Features

If you are a group leader, you have additional capabilities in the Conversations tab:

- **Post announcements** -- Switch to the **Announcements** sub-tab and post messages that all group members can read.
- **Post discussions** -- You can also participate in regular discussions just like any other member.

:::info
Conversations are specific to each group. Messages you post in one group will not appear in another group's conversations.
