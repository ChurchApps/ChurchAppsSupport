# Groups

Groups are a great way to get connected with others at your church. Whether you are looking for a small group, a ministry team, a Bible study, or a volunteer opportunity, you can browse and join groups directly from your church's B1.church site.

## What You Can Do

Here is what you can do with groups in B1App:

- **Browse public groups** -- View all available groups organized by category. Each group shows a photo, name, meeting time, location, and a brief description.
- **View group details** -- Click any group to see its full description, leaders, upcoming calendar events, and a contact form to reach out to the group's leaders.
- **Join groups** -- Connect with a group to become a member and gain access to additional features.
- **Participate in conversations** -- Once you are a member of a group, you can post messages and interact with other group members through the Conversations tab.
- **Access calendars and resources** -- View upcoming events on the group calendar and download shared files or links from the Resources tab.

## Public vs. Logged-In Experience

Anyone can visit your church's groups page and browse the available groups. Visitors who are not logged in can view group descriptions, see who the leaders are, check upcoming calendar events, and send a message to a leader using the contact form.

When you log in, you unlock additional tabs on the group detail page, including **Group Details**, **Calendar**, **Conversations**, **Resources**, **Members**, and **Attendance**. Group leaders have extra editing capabilities on each of these tabs.
