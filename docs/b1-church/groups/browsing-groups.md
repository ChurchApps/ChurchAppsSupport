# Browsing Groups

Your church's public groups page makes it easy to discover groups that interest you. Groups are organized by category, so you can quickly scan through different types of groups and find the right fit.

## Finding the Groups Page

Navigate to the **Groups** page on your church's B1.church site. This page is publicly accessible, so you do not need to be logged in to browse.

## How Groups Are Organized

Groups are displayed by **category** (also called a label). Categories are set up by your church's administrators and might include labels such as "Small Groups," "Ministries," "Youth," or "Bible Studies." Each category shows all the groups that belong to it.

## Reading Group Cards

Each group is displayed as a card with the following information:

- **Group photo** -- A cover image representing the group. If no photo has been set, a default image is shown.
- **Group name** -- Displayed prominently over the photo.
- **Meeting time** -- When the group typically meets (for example, "Wednesdays at 7 PM"). If no time is set, a placeholder is shown.
- **Meeting location** -- Where the group meets. If no location is set, a placeholder is shown.
- **Description** -- A brief preview of what the group is about, limited to a few lines. Click the group to read the full description.

## Viewing a Group

Click on any group card to open the full group detail page. There you will find the complete description, information about the group's leaders, upcoming calendar events, and a way to get in touch.

:::tip
If you are looking for a specific type of group, scan the category headings first. This helps you skip straight to the section that interests you rather than scrolling through every group.
