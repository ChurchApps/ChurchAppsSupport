# Group Details

When you click on a group from the groups page, you are taken to the group detail page. What you see on this page depends on whether you are logged in or not.

## Visitor View (Not Logged In)

If you are not logged in, you will see the following:

- **Hero section** -- A large banner area showing the group's photo, name, meeting time, and meeting location.
- **Description** -- The full description of the group explaining its purpose and what to expect.
- **Leaders** -- Avatars and names of the group's leaders. You can click a leader's name to view their profile.
- **Calendar events** -- Up to three upcoming events for the group are displayed, each showing the date and event title. If the group has no upcoming events, this section is hidden.
- **Contact form** -- A form that lets you send a message directly to the group's leaders. Fill in your first name, last name, email, phone number, and message, then click **Submit**. If there are multiple leaders, you can choose which one to contact from a dropdown.
