# Verse of the Day

The Verse of the Day page displays a daily Bible verse as a beautifully formatted image. It is a simple way to start your day with Scripture or find encouragement throughout the week.

## Viewing the Verse

1. Navigate to the **Verse of the Day** page from your church's site navigation.
2. The page displays today's verse as an image.
3. A new verse appears automatically each day.

There is nothing you need to do -- just visit the page and the current day's verse will be shown.

## Responsive Display

The verse image automatically adjusts to fit your screen. Depending on your device and window size, you will see one of three formats:

- **Widescreen (16:9)** -- Best for desktop monitors and laptops
- **Square (1:1)** -- Suited for tablet-sized screens
- **Portrait (9:16)** -- Optimized for phones held vertically

The page detects your screen dimensions and selects the best format, so the verse always looks good regardless of how you are viewing it. If you resize your browser window, the image will update to match the new dimensions.

## Availability

The Verse of the Day is a built-in content feature of B1.church. If you do not see it in your church's navigation, your church administrator may not have added it to the site menu. Contact your church administrator to request it.
