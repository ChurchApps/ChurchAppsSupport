<h4>Before You Begin</h4>

- No login is required to view the Verse of the Day. The page is publicly accessible.
- Your church must have added a Verse of the Day page to their site navigation.

</div>

## Viewing the Verse

1. Navigate to the **Verse of the Day** page from your church's site navigation.
2. The page displays today's verse as an image.
3. A new verse appears automatically each day.

There is nothing you need to do -- just visit the page and the current day's verse will be shown.

## Responsive Display

The verse image automatically adjusts to fit your screen. Depending on your device and window size, you will see one of three formats:

- **Widescreen (16:9)** -- Best for desktop monitors and laptops
- **Square (1:1)** -- Suited for tablet-sized screens
- **Portrait (9:16)** -- Optimized for phones held vertically

The page detects your screen dimensions and selects the best format, so the verse always looks good regardless of how you are viewing it. If you resize your browser window, the image will update to match the new dimensions.
