# Lessons

<div class="article-intro">

The **Lessons** tab gives you access to your church's curriculum and learning materials. Content is provided through the Lessons.church platform and is embedded directly within B1.church, so you do not need to navigate to a separate site.

</div>

<div class="prereqs">
<h4>Before You Begin</h4>

- You must be [logged in](../getting-started/logging-in.md) to your B1.church account. The Lessons tab is located in the member area and requires authentication.
- Your church must have configured curriculum through Lessons.church.

</div>

## Accessing Lessons

1. Log in to your B1.church member portal.
2. Click the **Lessons** tab in the [member navigation](../getting-started/navigating.md).
3. The Lessons.church content loads directly within the page.

Your login carries over automatically when you open the Lessons tab. You do not need to sign in again separately to Lessons.church.

## What You Can Do

Once inside the Lessons tab, you can browse the curriculum your church has made available. Depending on what your church has set up, you may find:

- **Lesson plans** -- Structured outlines with sections and activities
- **Presentations and media** -- Slides, videos, and images to accompany lessons
- **Downloadable resources** -- Files and add-ons for further study

You can click on individual sections within a lesson to view their content in a dialog window. Use the **Back** button to return to the section list, or **Close** to exit the dialog.

:::tip
Lessons shared with your groups will also appear on your [Timeline](../community/timeline.md), making it easy to find assigned curriculum without navigating to the Lessons tab directly.

## Availability

The Lessons tab appears when your church has configured curriculum through Lessons.church. If you do not see a **Lessons** tab in your member navigation, your church may not have lesson content set up. Contact your church administrator for more information.
