# Content

B1.church gives your congregation a central place to access the content your church shares. Depending on what your church has configured, you may have access to sermons, live streaming, Bible reading, a daily verse, and lesson materials -- all from within the member portal.

## Available Content Features

### Sermons

Browse and watch recorded sermons from your church. Your church's sermon library is organized into playlists and series, making it easy to find past messages.

### Live Streaming

Watch your church's live broadcast directly in B1.church. When a service is live, you can join the stream and interact with other viewers through chat and prayer features.

### Bible

Read Scripture using the built-in Bible reader. You can navigate through books, chapters, and verses without leaving the site.

### Verse of the Day

View a beautifully formatted Bible verse image that changes every day. The image automatically adjusts to fit your screen.

### Lessons

Access your church's curriculum and learning materials through the embedded Lessons.church platform. Your login carries over automatically, so you can jump straight into the content.

## Finding Content

Content pages are available through your church's site navigation. Your church administrator decides which content features are enabled and how they appear in the menu. If you do not see a particular content feature listed above, it may not be configured for your church.
