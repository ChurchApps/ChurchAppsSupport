# Live Streaming

<div class="article-intro">

The Live Stream page lets you watch your church's services as they happen, right from B1.church. When your church is broadcasting, you can tune in and participate using interactive features alongside the video.

</div>

<div class="prereqs">
<h4>Before You Begin</h4>

- No login is required to watch a live stream. The Stream page is publicly accessible.
- Your church must have a streaming schedule configured. Check your church's service times for when live broadcasts are available.

</div>

## Watching a Live Stream

1. Navigate to the **Stream** page from your church's site navigation.
2. If a service is currently live or about to start, the video player will load automatically.
3. Watch the broadcast directly on the page.

When no live stream is currently active, you may see offline content or information about the next scheduled service time.

## Interactive Features

The live stream page can include interactive tabs alongside the video, depending on what your church has configured. These may include:

- **Chat** -- Send messages and interact with other viewers during the broadcast. Chat is typically enabled a few minutes before the service starts and remains available for a period after it ends.
- **Prayer** -- Submit a prayer request during the service. A streaming host on your church's team can respond privately.
- **Additional tabs** -- Your church may add custom tabs with links to bulletins, sermon notes, [giving pages](../giving/making-donations.md), or other resources.

Click on the tab icons or labels to switch between the available features while watching.

## Before and After the Service

Your church sets specific times for when the stream and interactive features become available. You may be able to join the chat before the service officially begins, giving you time to greet others. After the service ends, chat may remain open briefly for continued conversation.

:::info
If the stream page shows offline content or a countdown, the next scheduled service has not started yet. Check back at the listed service time.
