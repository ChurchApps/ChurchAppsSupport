# Sermons

The Sermons page lets you browse and watch recorded sermons from your church. Your church's sermon library is displayed using the appearance and layout your church has configured, so the look and feel will match your church's branding.

## Browsing Sermons

1. Navigate to the **Sermons** page from your church's site navigation.
2. You will see a listing of available sermons, typically organized by playlist or series.
3. Click on any sermon to watch or listen to it.

Sermons may include video or audio content hosted on platforms like YouTube, Vimeo, or Facebook. When you click a sermon, the media plays directly on the page.

## What You Will See

Each sermon entry can display:

- **Title** -- The name of the sermon
- **Speaker** -- Who delivered the message
- **Date** -- When the sermon was recorded or published
- **Description** -- A summary of the sermon content
- **Thumbnail** -- A preview image for the sermon

Your church organizes sermons into playlists or series. This makes it easy to follow along with a multi-week series or find sermons on a particular topic.

:::tip
If you are looking for a live broadcast rather than a recorded sermon, check the [Live Streaming](live-streaming) page instead.

## Availability

The Sermons page is available when your church has added sermon content through their admin portal. If you do not see a Sermons link in your church's navigation, your church may not have this feature configured yet. Contact your church administrator for more information.
