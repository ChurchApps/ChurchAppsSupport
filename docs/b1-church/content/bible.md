<div class="article-intro">

B1.church includes a built-in Bible reader so you can read Scripture without leaving the site. The reader is embedded directly in the page, giving you quick access to any passage right alongside your other church tools.

</div>

<div class="prereqs">
<h4>Before You Begin</h4>

- No login is required to use the Bible reader. The Bible page is publicly accessible.
- Your church must have added a Bible page to their site navigation.

</div>

## Reading the Bible

1. Navigate to the **Bible** page from your church's site navigation.
2. The reader opens to Genesis 1:1 by default.
3. Use the navigation controls within the reader to move to a different book, chapter, or verse.

The Bible reader uses the NIRV (New International Reader's Version) translation by default.

## Navigating Passages

The embedded reader provides controls for moving through Scripture. You can:

- Browse to a specific book of the Bible
- Jump to a particular chapter
- Scroll through verses within a chapter

The reader fills the content area of the page, giving you plenty of space to read comfortably.

:::tip
You can bookmark the Bible page in your browser to return to it quickly for your daily reading. Pair it with the [Verse of the Day](./verse-of-the-day.md) for daily Scripture inspiration.

## Availability

The Bible page is a built-in content feature of B1.church. If you do not see a **Bible** link in your church's navigation, your church administrator may not have added it to the site menu. Contact your church administrator to request it.
