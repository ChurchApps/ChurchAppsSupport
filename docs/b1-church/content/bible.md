# Bible

B1.church includes a built-in Bible reader so you can read Scripture without leaving the site. The reader is embedded directly in the page, giving you quick access to any passage.

## Reading the Bible

1. Navigate to the **Bible** page from your church's site navigation.
2. The reader opens to Genesis 1:1 by default.
3. Use the navigation controls within the reader to move to a different book, chapter, or verse.

The Bible reader uses the NIRV (New International Reader's Version) translation by default.

## Navigating Passages

The embedded reader provides controls for moving through Scripture. You can:

- Browse to a specific book of the Bible
- Jump to a particular chapter
- Scroll through verses within a chapter

The reader fills the content area of the page, giving you plenty of space to read comfortably.

:::tip
You can bookmark the Bible page in your browser to return to it quickly for your daily reading.

## Availability

The Bible page is a built-in content feature of B1.church. If you do not see a Bible link in your church's navigation, your church administrator may not have added it to the site menu. Contact your church administrator to request it.
