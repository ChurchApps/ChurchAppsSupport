# Getting Started with B1.church

<div class="article-intro">

B1.church is your church's online home. It is where you go to stay connected with your congregation, view updates, give online, check in for services, and much more. This section walks you through the basics of accessing and using the member portal.

## Accessing Your Church's Site

Your church has its own B1.church URL, typically in the format `https://yourchurchname.b1.church`. You can visit this URL in any web browser on your computer, tablet, or phone. Your church leadership or welcome team can provide you with the exact address.

When you first visit the site, you will see your church's public website with its custom branding, navigation menus, and content pages.

## Creating an Account

To access the member portal and its features, you need a ChurchApps account.

1. Visit your church's B1.church URL.
2. Click the **Login** button in the top-right corner of the page.
3. On the login screen, select the option to **Register** a new account.
4. Enter your **first name**, **last name**, **email address**, and choose a **password**.

After registering, you can log in and access the member portal with all of its tools.

If your church has already added you to their system, use the same email address they have on file. This will link your account to your existing church profile.
