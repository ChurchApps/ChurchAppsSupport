# Logging In

Logging in to B1.church gives you access to the member portal where you can view your timeline, manage groups, give online, and use all of the tools your church has set up.

## How to Log In

1. Go to your church's B1.church URL (for example, `https://yourchurchname.b1.church`).
2. Click the **Login** button in the top-right corner of the header.
3. Enter your **email address** and **password**.
4. Click **Sign In**.

After signing in, you will be taken back to the page you were on before you clicked login. If you navigated directly to a member portal page while logged out, you will be returned to that page automatically after signing in.

## Accessing the Member Portal

Once logged in, you can access the member portal by clicking on your **name** in the top-right corner of the page and selecting **Member Portal** from the menu. The member portal is where all of your personal church tools live, including your timeline, groups, giving, and more.

## Your User Menu

After logging in, your name appears as a chip in the top-right corner. Click it to open a menu with the following options:

- **Member Portal** -- Go to your personal member portal dashboard.
- **Edit Profile** -- Update your account settings or edit your church profile.
- **Logout** -- Sign out of your account.

## Admin Access

If you are a church administrator with the appropriate permissions, you will also see an **Admin Portal** option in your user menu. Clicking it takes you to B1 Admin where you can manage your church's settings, people, groups, and content.

If you have forgotten your password, use the **Forgot Password** link on the login page to reset it. You will receive an email with instructions to create a new password.

## Logging Out
