# Navigating B1App

The member portal in B1.church uses a sidebar navigation layout that makes it easy to move between the different tools available to you. This page explains how the navigation works on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Sidebar Navigation

When you enter the member portal, you will see a vertical sidebar on the left side of the screen. This sidebar contains tabs for each section of the portal:

- **Timeline** -- Your personalized feed of updates and conversations from your groups and church. This is the default tab that loads when you open the member portal.
- **Groups** -- View and interact with the groups you belong to.
- **Community** -- Browse the church member directory.
- **Plans** -- See upcoming service plans and your assigned volunteer positions.
- **Check-in** -- Check in yourself and your household for services and events.
- **Lessons** -- Access Bible study lessons and curriculum.
- **Donations** -- Make online donations and view your giving history.

Click any tab to switch to that section. The active tab is highlighted so you always know where you are.

:::note
The tabs you see may vary depending on what your church has enabled. Church administrators control which sections are visible to members through B1 Admin. If you do not see a particular tab, your church may not have turned on that feature.

## Mobile Navigation

On smaller screens such as phones and tablets, the sidebar collapses to save space. Instead, you will see a **Menu** button at the top of the member portal. Tap it to open a list of all the available tabs. Select a tab to navigate to that section, and the menu will close automatically.

## Admin Tab

If you have administrator permissions at your church, you will see an additional **Admin** tab at the bottom of the sidebar. Clicking it takes you to B1 Admin where you can manage your church's settings and data.

## Top Header Navigation

Outside of the member portal, the main site header contains your church's custom navigation links. These are configured by your church's administrators and may include links to pages like sermons, the Bible, live streaming, and other content. On mobile, these links are accessible through a hamburger menu icon in the top-right corner of the header.
