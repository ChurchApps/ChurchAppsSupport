# Check-In

<div class="article-intro">

The **Check-In** feature in B1.church allows you to check in yourself and your household members for church services directly from the member portal. This is a convenient way to record your attendance without needing to visit a physical check-in kiosk.

</div>

## How It Works

When you use self check-in, you select a service, choose which household members are attending, and assign each person to the appropriate group for each service time. Once you confirm, your attendance is recorded automatically.

## Getting Started

To access check-in, click **Check-In** in the [sidebar navigation](../getting-started/navigating.md) of your member portal. You must be [logged in](../getting-started/logging-in.md) to use this feature -- if you are not signed in, you will be prompted to log in first.

:::info
The check-in feature requires that your church has set up services and attendance groups in their administration settings. If no services are available when you open the check-in page, your church may not have this feature configured yet. Contact your church administrator for help.
