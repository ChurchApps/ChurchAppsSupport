# Self Check-In

The self check-in process lets you record attendance for yourself and your household in just a few steps. Navigate to the **Check-In** tab in the sidebar to get started.

## The Check-In Flow

Check-in follows a simple three-step process:

### Step 1: Select a Service

When you open the check-in page, you will see a list of available services (for example, "Sunday Morning" or "Wednesday Evening"). Each service card shows the service name and campus if your church has multiple locations.

Click on a service to select it and move to the next step.

### Step 2: Select Household Members and Groups

After selecting a service, you will see a list of your household members. For each person attending:

1. Tap a household member to expand their entry.
2. You will see the available **service times** for the service you selected.
3. Click **Select Group** next to a service time to choose which group the person should be checked into (such as "Main Worship," "Kids Room 1," or "Youth Group").
4. Repeat for each household member who is attending.

You do not need to check in every household member -- only expand and assign groups for the people who are actually present.

### Step 3: Confirmation

Once you have selected groups for everyone who is attending, click the **Complete Check-in** button at the bottom of the page.

You will see a confirmation screen with the message "Check-in Complete!" along with a note that your attendance has been saved. Click **Back to My Page** to return to the timeline.

If you need to change a group selection before completing check-in, tap the **Change** button next to any service time to pick a different group.

## Things to Know

- You can only check in household members that are linked to your account. If a family member is missing, ask your church administrator to add them to your household.
- If no services appear on the check-in page, your church may not have any services configured for check-in at this time.
