# Donation History

When you are logged in, you can view a complete record of your past donations and generate giving statements for tax purposes. Your donation history is available from the **Donate** section of your B1.church account.

## Viewing Your History

1. Log in to your B1.church account.
2. Navigate to the **Donate** section.
3. Click **History** in the left panel to view your past donations.

Your donation history is displayed as a table with the following columns:

- **Date** -- When the donation was made.
- **Method** -- How you paid (for example, "Card - Visa" or "Bank - ACH").
- **Fund** -- Which fund the donation was directed to (for example, General Fund, Building Fund).
- **Amount** -- The dollar amount of the donation.

Donations that are still being processed will appear with a "Pending" label next to the fund name and the amount shown in a different color.

## Exporting and Printing Statements

Click the **download** button in the Donation History header to access export options:

- **Current Year (CSV)** -- Download a CSV file of all your donations from the current year. You can open this in a spreadsheet application.
- **Current Year (Print)** -- Open a printable giving statement for the current year.
- **Last Year (CSV)** -- Download a CSV file of all your donations from the previous year.
- **Last Year (Print)** -- Open a printable giving statement for the previous year.
