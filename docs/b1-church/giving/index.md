# Giving

<div class="article-intro">

B1App makes it easy to support your church through online donations. Whether you want to make a quick one-time gift or manage recurring giving, everything you need is available from your church's B1.church site.

</div>

## Overview

B1App supports two ways to give:

- **Public donations** -- Anyone can make a donation without logging in. Visit your church's donate page, select a fund, and enter your payment details. No account is required.
- **Authenticated giving** -- When you [log in](../getting-started/logging-in.md) before donating, your gifts are linked to your account. This gives you access to your full donation history, printable giving statements, recurring donation management, and saved payment methods.

## What You Can Do

Here is what is available in the giving section:

- **Give to specific funds** -- Your church may have multiple funds set up, such as a General Fund, Building Fund, or Missions Fund. You can choose which fund to direct your donation to.
- **Pay with card or bank account** -- Donations are processed securely through Stripe. You can pay with a credit or debit card. ACH bank payment instructions are also available.
- **Set up recurring donations** -- Logged-in members can schedule automatic recurring donations so you never miss a gift.
- **View donation history** -- See a complete list of your past donations, including the date, method, fund, and amount.
- **Print giving statements** -- Generate printable giving statements for the current year or previous year for your tax records.
- **Manage payment methods** -- Save and manage your payment methods for faster giving in the future.

Donations are processed securely through **Stripe**. Your payment information is never stored on B1.church servers.
