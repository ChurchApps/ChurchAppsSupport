# Making a Donation

<div class="article-intro">

There are two ways to make a donation through your church's B1.church site: the public donation page (no login required) and the member donation page (login required). Both use a secure donation form powered by Stripe.

</div>

<div class="prereqs">
<h4>Before You Begin</h4>

- For public donations, no account is needed -- just visit your church's **Donate** page.
- For member donations with history tracking and saved payment methods, [log in](../getting-started/logging-in.md) to your account first.

</div>

## Public Donation Page (No Login Required)

Anyone can make a donation without creating an account:

1. Navigate to your church's **Donate** page.
2. The donation form is displayed on the left side of the page. Select the **fund** you would like to give to.
3. Enter your payment details and the amount you would like to give.
4. Submit the form to complete your donation.

On the right side of the page, you will see a link to **Instructions for ACH Payment** if you prefer to give via bank transfer. There is also a **Login** button if you want to sign in to access additional features like donation history.

:::tip
If you are already logged in when you visit the public donate page, you will be automatically redirected to the member donation page where you have access to your full giving history and saved payment methods.

## Member Donation Page (Logged In)

When you are logged in, the donation experience includes additional features:

1. Click the **Donate** tab (or navigate to **My Donations**).
2. You will see a panel with three sections:
   - **Give Now** -- Make a one-time or recurring donation.
   - **History** -- View your past donations and export records.
   - **Recurring Donations** -- Manage scheduled giving and payment methods.
3. Select **Give Now** to open the donation form.
4. Choose the **fund** you would like to give to and enter your donation amount.
5. Select an existing saved payment method or enter new payment details.
6. Submit the form to complete your donation.

After your donation is processed, a success message will appear and your donation will show up in your [donation history](./donation-history.md).

## Payment Methods

Donations are processed securely through **Stripe**. You can pay with a credit card, debit card, or set up an ACH bank payment. When you are logged in, your payment methods can be saved for future use, making it faster to give next time.

:::warning
If your donation does not go through, double-check your payment details and try again. If the issue persists, contact your church office for assistance.
