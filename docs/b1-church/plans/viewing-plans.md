# Viewing Plans

The Plans page gives you a clear view of all the service plans you are assigned to. It uses a master-detail layout so you can quickly browse your plans and dive into the details of any one.

## Accessing Your Plans

1. Click **Plans** in the sidebar navigation.
2. You will see a list of your plans on the left side of the page.

## The Plan List

Your plans are listed in the left panel under **My Plans**. Each entry shows:

- The **plan name** (for example, "Sunday Worship" or "Kids Ministry")
- The **service date**
- Your **position** (the role you are filling)
- Your **status** -- color-coded so you can see at a glance whether you have accepted, declined, or not yet responded

At the top of the list, you will also see a **Blockout Dates** option. Click it to manage dates when you are unavailable for serving. You can add, edit, and remove blockout date ranges so your team leaders know when to schedule around you.

## Viewing Plan Details

Click on any plan in the list to open its details in the right panel. The detail view includes:

- **Position details** -- Your assigned position with the needed times and your current status. If you have not yet responded, you can click **Accept** or **Decline** directly from this view.
- **Notes** -- Any notes the plan creator added for the team.
- **Order of Service** -- The full service order with timing, items, and descriptions. See [Service Order](./service-order) for more details.
- **Team assignments** -- A summary of all team members and their positions, so you can see who else is serving alongside you.

:::tip
If you have multiple assignments across different plans, the list is sorted by date so your upcoming commitments appear first. Check back regularly to stay on top of your schedule.
