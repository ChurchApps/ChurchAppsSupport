# Plans

The **Plans** section in B1.church lets you see the service plans you have been assigned to. Whether you are on the worship team, helping with kids ministry, or serving in another area, this is where you can find out when you are scheduled, what position you are filling, and what the service looks like.

## What You Will Find

Plans can include several types of content depending on how your church sets them up:

- **Your assignments** -- See which positions you have been assigned to and when you are needed. Each assignment shows your position name, the service date, and your current status (Accepted, Declined, or Unconfirmed).
- **Service order** -- View the order of service with timing details, song information, and item descriptions so you know the flow of the service ahead of time.
- **Curriculum content** -- Some plans include associated lesson or curriculum content from providers like Lessons.church. You can preview this content directly within the plan.
- **Blockout dates** -- Let your team leaders know when you are unavailable by managing your blockout dates.

## Getting Started

To access your plans, click **Plans** in the sidebar navigation of your member portal. You must be logged in to view your plans -- if you are not signed in, you will be prompted to log in first.

You will only see plans that you have been assigned to. If you do not see any plans listed, it means you have not been added to a serving team yet. Talk to your church administrator or ministry leader to get involved.
