# Service Order

When you open a plan, the **Order of Service** section shows the sequence of items for that service. This gives you and your team a shared view of the service flow, including timing, song details, and descriptions for each element.

## What the Service Order Shows

The service order is displayed as a list of items in the order they will occur during the service. Each item includes:

- **Cumulative time** -- The running time from the start of the service, so you know when each element is expected to begin.
- **Item label and description** -- The name of the element (such as a song title, prayer, or announcement) along with any notes or descriptions.
- **Duration** -- How long the item is expected to take.

Items are organized under **headers** that group related elements together (for example, "Worship Set" or "Message"). This makes it easy to scan the overall structure of the service.

## Curriculum and Lesson Content

If the plan has associated curriculum or lesson content from a provider like Lessons.church, you will see a preview of that content within the service order. This can include lesson sections, presentation materials, and other resources your team needs for the service.

## Printing the Service Order

You can print a formatted version of the service order to bring with you on the day of the service.

1. Open the plan from your **Plans** list.
2. In the **Order of Service** section, click the **print** icon in the top-right corner.
3. A new window opens with a printable layout that includes:
   - The **service date** at the top.
   - **Team assignments** grouped by category on the left, showing each position and who is filling it.
   - The **full service order** on the right with time, item details, and duration columns.
4. Your browser's print dialog will open automatically so you can print or save as PDF.

:::tip
The printed service order is a great reference to have on hand during rehearsals or the service itself. It includes both the team roster and the full order of service on a single page.
