# FreePlay Overview

FreePlay is a TV app for churches that displays lesson content on classroom TVs. It runs on Android TV, Amazon Fire TV, and Apple TV, and is designed to work without an internet connection on Sunday mornings. Volunteers can pre-download lesson materials during the week, then simply press play when class begins.

## Key Features

- **Offline playback** - Download videos and image slides ahead of time so you never depend on Wi-Fi during services
- **Classroom pairing** - Connect your TV to a specific room and automatically receive scheduled lesson content
- **Plan pairing** - Link your device to a church service plan for coordinated content across rooms
- **Content providers** - Browse and download content from external sources like Lessons.church and Bible Project
- **TV remote friendly** - Navigate the entire app with a standard TV remote using directional buttons and select
- **Collapsible sidebar** - A slim sidebar keeps navigation accessible without cluttering the screen

## How It Works

When you launch FreePlay, it connects to your content providers and checks for available content. From there you can browse folders, download media, and play lessons -- all optimized for a big-screen TV experience.
