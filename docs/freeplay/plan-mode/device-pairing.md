# Pairing Your Device

To use Plan Mode, you need to pair your TV with a plan type in B1 Admin. FreePlay generates a unique pairing code that links the device to your church's plan.

## Generating the Pairing Code

1. From the **Select Pairing Mode** screen, choose **Pair to Plan**
2. FreePlay contacts the server and generates a short pairing code
3. The code appears in large characters at the center of the screen
4. Below the code, a pulsing indicator shows **Waiting for connection**

The code is displayed as individual characters for easy reading from across the room.

## Entering the Code in B1 Admin

1. On a computer or phone, open **B1 Admin** for your church
2. Navigate to the **Plan Type** settings for the plan you want to assign
3. Enter the pairing code shown on the TV
4. Save the settings

FreePlay polls the server every few seconds, checking whether the pairing is complete. Once B1 Admin confirms the connection, the TV automatically moves to the plan download screen.

## Downloading Plan Content

After pairing, FreePlay loads the current plan for that plan type. It displays:

- The plan name and service date
- The associated lesson name (if the plan includes lesson content)
- A progress indicator showing **Downloading item X of Y**

When all media files are downloaded, the **Start Plan** button appears. Press **Select** on your remote to begin playback.

:::tip
The plan refreshes automatically every hour. If the plan is updated during the day, FreePlay picks up the changes without any manual intervention.

## Alternative: Search by Church Name

If you prefer not to use the pairing code flow, you can select **or search by church name** at the bottom of the pairing screen. This takes you to the church search screen where you can find your church and connect to a classroom instead.

## If Pairing Fails

If the pairing code cannot be generated (for example, due to a network issue), you will see an error message with a **Try Again** button. Make sure your TV is connected to the internet and try again.

:::note
Pairing codes expire after a set period. If you wait too long, generate a new code by returning to the pairing screen.
