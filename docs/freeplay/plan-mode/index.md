# Plan Mode

<div class="article-intro">

Plan Mode connects your TV to a church service plan. Instead of pulling content based on a classroom schedule, it follows the plan configured by your church leadership in B1 Admin. This is ideal when you want a TV to display exactly what is assigned in the current week's plan.

</div>

## How It Differs from Classroom Mode

- **[Classroom Mode](../classroom-mode/)** fetches the lesson scheduled for a specific room on a given date
- **Plan Mode** fetches the content tied to a plan type, which can include lessons, provider presentations, add-ons, and other media arranged in a custom order

Plan Mode is especially useful when your service plan includes a mix of content from different sources, all organized into a single sequence.

## How It Works

1. FreePlay generates a pairing code on screen
2. An administrator enters that code in **B1 Admin** under the plan type settings
3. Once paired, FreePlay loads the current plan and downloads all associated media
4. Press **Start Plan** to begin playback

The TV stays paired to the plan type. Each week, it automatically picks up the latest plan and its content.
