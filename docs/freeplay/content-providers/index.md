# Content Providers

<div class="article-intro">

Content providers are external services that supply lesson materials, videos, and images for playback on your TV. FreePlay supports multiple providers, letting you browse and download content from different sources all in one app.

## Available Providers

FreePlay currently includes the following providers:

- **[Lessons.church](../../lessons-church/)** - Free, open-source children's ministry curriculum

## How Providers Work

Each provider has its own content library organized into folders and files. Once you connect to a provider, its content appears in a folder browser where you can drill into categories, select items, and download them for playback.

Connected providers appear in the sidebar on the left side of the screen. You can switch between providers by selecting them in the sidebar, making it easy to jump between content sources during setup.
