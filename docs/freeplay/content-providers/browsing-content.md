# Browsing and Downloading Content

<div class="article-intro">

Once you have connected to a content provider, you can browse its library, download files, and play them on your TV. The content browser provides a visual grid of folders and files that you navigate with your TV remote.

</div>

<div class="prereqs">
<h4>Before You Begin</h4>

- Connect to at least one content provider -- see [Connecting to Providers](./connecting-providers)
- Have your TV remote ready for navigation

</div>

## The Content Browser

The content browser displays items in a 3-column grid of cards. Each card shows a thumbnail image and a title. There are two types of items:

- **Folders** - Represented by a thumbnail or folder icon. Select a folder to see its contents.
- **Files** - Individual media items (videos or images). Video files display a play icon overlay on their thumbnail.

The header at the top of the screen shows the name of the current folder, or the provider name if you are at the root level.

## Navigating Folders

1. Use the directional pad on your remote to highlight a folder
2. Press **Select** to open it
3. The browser loads the folder's contents, which may be more folders or playable files
4. Press **Back** on your remote to go up one level

You can drill as deep as the provider's content structure allows. The browser keeps track of your folder path so you can navigate back through each level.

## Downloading and Playing Content

When you select a folder that contains playable files (or select an individual file), FreePlay moves to a download screen:

1. The content title appears on screen with a cover image from the selected folder
2. A progress bar shows **Downloading item X of Y** as files are saved to your device
3. Once downloading is complete, the **Start** button appears with a play icon
4. Press **Select** to begin playback

:::tip
Downloaded content is cached on your TV. If you play the same content again later, it loads instantly without re-downloading.

## Playing Provider Content

Playback works the same way as lesson playback. Use these controls:

- **Right arrow** - Next item
- **Left arrow** - Previous item
- **Select / Play-Pause** - Pause or resume video
- **Up arrow** - Open the message selector to jump to a specific item
- **Back** - Exit to the content browser

When you exit the player, you return to the content browser at the root level of the current provider.

:::info
For a complete reference of all player controls, see [Playing Lessons](../classroom-mode/playing-lessons).

## Switching Between Providers

Connected providers appear as items in the sidebar on the left. To switch to a different provider:

1. Press the **Left** arrow on your remote to expand the sidebar
2. Select the provider you want to browse
3. The content browser refreshes with that provider's library

:::warning
If a folder shows "No content available," the provider does not have any items at that level. Try navigating to a different folder or checking back later.
