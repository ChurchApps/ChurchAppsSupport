# Connecting to Providers

Before you can browse content from a provider, you need to connect to it. Some providers require authentication, while others can be connected with a single click.

## Browsing Available Providers

1. Open the **Content Providers** screen from the sidebar (select the **Providers** icon at the bottom)
2. You will see a grid of provider cards, each showing the provider's logo and name
3. Connected providers display a green **Connected** badge below their name
4. Providers that are not yet available show a **Coming Soon** label

## Connecting Without Authentication

Some providers do not require a login. When you select one of these providers, FreePlay connects immediately and opens the content browser. No credentials are needed.

## Device Flow Authentication (QR Code)

Certain providers use a device flow, similar to how you sign in to streaming apps on a TV:

1. Select the provider card on the **Content Providers** screen
2. FreePlay displays a QR code and a verification URL
3. Scan the QR code with your phone, or visit the displayed URL on any device
4. Enter the user code shown on the TV screen
5. Complete the sign-in process on your phone or computer
6. FreePlay detects the successful login and displays **Connected!**
7. The content browser opens automatically

A pulsing **Waiting for authorization** indicator shows that FreePlay is checking for your login. The code expires after several minutes, so complete the process promptly.

## Form Login

Other providers use a traditional email and password login:

1. Select the provider card
2. Enter your **Email** and **Password** using the on-screen keyboard
3. Select the **Sign In** button
4. If your credentials are correct, FreePlay displays **Connected!** and opens the content browser

:::tip
Use the directional pad on your remote to move between the email field, password field, and sign-in button. Press **Select** on a text field to open the on-screen keyboard.

## Disconnecting a Provider

To disconnect from a provider you have already connected:

1. Go to the **Content Providers** screen
2. Select the provider card that shows the **Connected** badge
3. A confirmation prompt asks if you want to disconnect
4. Choose **Disconnect** to remove the connection

After disconnecting, the provider's content will no longer appear in your sidebar.

:::note
Disconnecting removes the saved authentication from your device. You will need to sign in again if you want to reconnect later.
