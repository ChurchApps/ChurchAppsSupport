# Playing Lessons

<div class="article-intro">

The FreePlay media player is a full-screen experience designed for TV remotes. It plays both videos and image slides, advancing through the lesson content automatically or manually, giving teachers full control over the pace of their lesson.

## Player Controls

Use your TV remote to control playback:

| Remote Button | Action |
|---|---|
| **Select / Play-Pause** | Pause or resume the current video |
| **Right arrow / Fast Forward** | Skip to the next slide or video |
| **Left arrow / Rewind** | Go back to the previous slide or video |
| **Up arrow** | Open the message selector to jump to a specific item |
| **Down / Back / Menu** | Exit the player and return to the previous screen |

:::tip
You can also swipe on touch-enabled remotes. Swipe left to go forward, swipe right to go back, swipe down to open the message selector, and swipe up to exit the player.

## Video Playback

When a video is playing, you will see the full-screen video content. Pressing **Select** or **Play-Pause** pauses the video and displays a pause icon overlay with a progress bar at the bottom of the screen. Press again to resume.

Videos automatically advance to the next item in the lesson when they finish. If a video is set to loop, it will repeat until you manually advance.

## Image Slides

Image slides display full-screen. Unlike videos, image slides do not auto-advance -- they stay on screen until you press the right arrow to move forward. This gives your teacher full control over pacing.

## Message Selector

Press the **Up** arrow during playback to open the message selector. This shows a grid of all items in the lesson with thumbnails and titles. Navigate to any item and press **Select** to jump directly to it. This is useful for skipping ahead or returning to a specific part of the lesson.

## Exiting the Player

Press **Down**, **Back**, or **Menu** on your remote to exit the player. You will return to the download screen (in Classroom Mode), the plan download screen (in Plan Mode), or the content browser (when playing provider content).

:::info
The screen stays awake while the player is active, so you do not need to worry about the TV going to sleep during a lesson.
