# Selecting Your Church and Room

<div class="article-intro">

Before FreePlay can download lessons for your classroom, you need to tell it which church and room to use. This is a one-time setup -- the TV remembers your selection for future sessions.

<div class="prereqs">
<h4>Before You Begin</h4>

- Install and launch FreePlay -- see [Getting Started](../getting-started/)
- Register your church and configure classrooms at [freeplay.church](https://freeplay.church)
- Choose **Pair to Classroom** from the [pairing mode screen](../getting-started/pairing-modes.md)

</div>

## Finding Your Church

1. From the **Select Pairing Mode** screen, choose **Pair to Classroom**
2. You will see the **Find Your Church** screen with a search field at the top
3. Using your TV remote, select the search field and type at least four letters of your church name
4. A list of matching churches appears below the search field
5. Navigate to your church in the list and press **Select** on your remote

:::warning
If your church does not appear in search results, it may not be registered yet. Visit [freeplay.church](https://freeplay.church) to register your church and configure your classrooms.

## Choosing a Classroom

After selecting your church, the **Select a Classroom** screen appears with a list of all configured rooms.

1. Use the up and down arrows on your remote to browse the list of classrooms
2. Highlight the room this TV is assigned to
3. Press **Select** on your remote

FreePlay saves your choice and immediately moves to the download screen to fetch the scheduled lesson.

:::tip
If you see "No classrooms found," your church's classrooms have not been configured yet. An administrator can set them up at [freeplay.church](https://freeplay.church).

## Changing Your Selection

To switch to a different church or room later, press the **Back** button on your TV remote from the download screen. This takes you back to the room selection screen where you can choose a different classroom, or continue pressing **Back** to return to the church search.
