# Downloading Lesson Content

Once you have selected a church and classroom, FreePlay automatically fetches the lesson scheduled for today and begins downloading all of its media files. This screen is where you wait for content to be ready before starting the lesson.

## How Downloading Works

1. FreePlay checks the schedule for your classroom and loads the assigned lesson
2. The lesson name, title, and description appear on screen, overlaid on the lesson's cover image
3. A progress indicator shows **Downloading item X of Y** as each file is saved to the device
4. When all files are downloaded, the **Start Lesson** button appears with a play icon

You do not need to do anything during the download. FreePlay handles everything automatically.

## Resolution

FreePlay downloads content at 720p by default. The resolution setting (720p or 1080p) determines the quality of downloaded video and image files. Higher resolution looks sharper on large TVs but takes longer to download and uses more storage.

The resolution is set to 720p by default. Content is downloaded at the resolution configured for your device.

## Starting the Lesson

Once downloading completes, the **Start Lesson** button fades in at the bottom of the screen. Use your TV remote to highlight it and press **Select** to begin playback.

## Automatic Refresh

FreePlay checks for updated content every hour. If the schedule changes during the day, the app picks up the new lesson automatically. You can also press **Back** on your remote to return to the room selection screen and re-enter the download screen to force a refresh.

:::tip
Download lessons before Sunday morning while your building has a strong internet connection. Once downloaded, the content plays offline without any network dependency.

## If the Schedule Is Empty

If no lesson is scheduled for the selected classroom, you will see the message "The schedule could not be loaded. Make sure a lesson is scheduled for this class." Check your schedule at [freeplay.church](https://freeplay.church) and make sure the correct lesson is assigned to this room.
