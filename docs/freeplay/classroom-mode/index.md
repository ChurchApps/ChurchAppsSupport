# Classroom Mode

Classroom Mode connects your TV to a specific room in your church. Once paired, FreePlay automatically downloads the lesson that is scheduled for that room, so your volunteers can simply press **Start Lesson** when class begins.

## How It Works

1. **Find your church** - Search for your church by name
2. **Select a room** - Pick the classroom this TV belongs to
3. **Download the lesson** - FreePlay fetches the scheduled lesson and downloads all media files
4. **Play** - Press the **Start Lesson** button and the lesson plays automatically

The TV remembers which church and room it is paired to, so you only need to go through setup once. Each week, FreePlay checks for the current day's scheduled lesson and downloads any new content.

:::tip
Make sure your classrooms are configured at [freeplay.church](https://freeplay.church) before pairing your TV. If no classrooms appear when you select your church, visit the website to set them up.
