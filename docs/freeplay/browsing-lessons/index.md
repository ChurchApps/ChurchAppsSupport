# Browsing Lessons

FreePlay includes a built-in lesson browser that lets you explore the full library of available programs, studies, and lessons. This is useful when you want to manually pick a lesson to play rather than relying on a classroom schedule or plan.

## The Browsing Flow

Lessons are organized in a hierarchy:

1. **Programs** - Top-level curriculum categories (e.g., a children's ministry series)
2. **Studies** - Groups of lessons within a program (e.g., a multi-week unit)
3. **Lessons** - Individual lesson sessions with their own content
4. **Venues** - Different versions of a lesson tailored for specific age groups or settings

You start by selecting a program, then drill into a study, choose a lesson, and finally pick a venue to begin playback.

## Accessing the Lesson Browser

The lesson browser is available through the **Browse Programs** screen. Navigate there using the sidebar or by selecting the browse option from the navigation.

Browsing lessons requires an internet connection to load the program catalog. Once you select a venue and begin playback, the content streams directly without a separate download step.
