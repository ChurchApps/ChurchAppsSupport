# Choosing a Pairing Mode

<div class="article-intro">

FreePlay offers two pairing modes for connecting your TV to your church, plus the ability to browse content providers directly. The **Select Pairing Mode** screen presents these options as large cards you can navigate with your TV remote.

## Pair to Classroom

Choose **Pair to Classroom** when you want a specific TV to always show the lesson scheduled for a particular room. This is the best option for children's ministry classrooms where lessons are assigned on a weekly schedule.

**How it works:** You search for your church by name, pick a classroom, and FreePlay automatically fetches whatever lesson is scheduled for that room today. Each Sunday morning, you just turn on the TV and the correct lesson is ready.

**Best for:** Dedicated classroom TVs that should always show the scheduled content for that room.

:::tip
Set up your classrooms at [freeplay.church](https://freeplay.church) before pairing your TV. This ensures your rooms appear when you search for your church.

## Pair to Plan

Choose **Pair to Plan** when you want to follow a church service plan. This mode generates a pairing code that you enter in **B1 Admin** to link the TV to a specific plan type. The TV then downloads and plays the content assigned to the current plan.

**How it works:** FreePlay displays a pairing code on screen. An administrator enters that code in the **Plan Type** settings within **B1 Admin**. Once paired, the TV automatically loads the current plan's content.

**Best for:** TVs that display content tied to your weekly service plan, such as worship lyrics or announcement slides.

## Content Providers

If you do not need to pair to a classroom or plan, you can browse content providers directly. Providers like [Lessons.church](../../lessons-church/) and Bible Project offer content you can download and play on demand.

**Best for:** TVs where volunteers manually choose what to play each week, or when you want to explore available content.

:::info
You can access the **Providers** screen at any time from the sidebar at the bottom of the navigation. You do not need to use a pairing mode to browse and play content.
