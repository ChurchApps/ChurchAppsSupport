# Getting Started with FreePlay

FreePlay is available for Android TV, Amazon Fire TV, and Apple TV. This guide walks you through installing the app and launching it for the first time.

## Installing FreePlay

### Android TV / Amazon Fire TV

1. Open the app store on your TV (Google Play Store or Amazon Appstore)
2. Search for **FreePlay**
3. Select the app and choose **Install**

### Apple TV

1. Open the **App Store** on your Apple TV
2. Search for **FreePlay**
3. Select the app and choose **Get**

## Launching the App

When you open FreePlay for the first time, you will see an animated splash screen with the FreePlay logo. The app checks for any previously connected content providers. If you have already connected a provider, it will take you directly to that provider's content browser. Otherwise, it will open the **Content Providers** screen where you can connect to your first content source.

## Navigating with Your TV Remote

FreePlay is built for TV remotes. Here are the controls you will use throughout the app:

- **Directional pad (up/down/left/right)** - Move between items on screen
- **Select / OK button** - Choose the highlighted item
- **Left arrow** - Open the sidebar from any screen
- **Right arrow** - Close the sidebar and return to the main content area
- **Back / Menu button** - Go back to the previous screen

:::tip
The sidebar collapses to a narrow strip of icons when you are browsing content. Press the left arrow on your remote to expand it and see the full labels.
