# Launch Your Church Website

<div class="article-intro">

B1.church includes a full website builder at no extra cost. This guide walks you through creating your church website from scratch — setting up your home page, configuring your look and feel, adding key pages, and optionally connecting online giving and event registration forms.

</div>

<div class="prereqs">
<h4>Before You Begin</h4>

- Have your church logo ready (PNG with transparent background works best)
- Choose 2–3 brand colors for your site
- If using a custom domain (e.g., yourchurch.com), have access to your DNS provider (GoDaddy, Cloudflare, etc.)
- If you want online giving on your site, complete [Online Giving Setup](../donations/online-giving-setup.md) (Stripe) first

</div>

## Step 1: Initial Website Setup

Start by creating your home page and basic site structure.

Follow the [Website Initial Setup](../website/initial-setup.md) guide to:

1. Navigate to **Website** in B1 Admin
2. Create your home page with a hero section, welcome message, and key information
3. Add your church name and tagline

## Step 2: Configure Appearance

Set your site's visual identity — colors, fonts, logo, and footer.

Follow the [Appearance](../website/appearance.md) guide to:

1. Upload your church logo
2. Set your primary and accent colors
3. Configure the navigation bar and footer
4. Preview your changes

:::tip
Keep your color palette simple — a primary color plus one accent color is usually enough. The website builder will handle the rest.

## Step 3: Add Content Pages

Build out the pages your visitors need most.

Follow the [Managing Pages](../website/managing-pages.md) guide to create pages like:

- **About** — Your church's story, beliefs, and leadership
- **Sermons** — Link to your [sermon library](../sermons/managing-sermons.md)
- **Events** — Upcoming events and registration
- **Give** — Online giving page (requires [Stripe setup](../donations/online-giving-setup.md))
- **Contact** — Location, service times, and contact info

## Step 4: Connect Your Domain

If you want to use your own domain name (like yourchurch.com) instead of the default B1 URL:

1. Go to **Website > Settings** in B1 Admin
2. Enter your custom domain
3. Update your DNS records at your domain provider to point to B1

:::info
DNS changes can take up to 48 hours to propagate. Your site may not be accessible from your custom domain immediately. The default B1 URL will continue to work during this time.
:::

## Step 5: Add Giving and Forms

Enhance your site with interactive elements:

- **Online Giving** — Add a giving section so members can donate directly from your website. See [Online Giving Setup](../donations/online-giving-setup.md) to configure Stripe first.
- **Registration Forms** — Embed [Stand Alone forms](../forms/creating-forms.md) for event signups, visitor cards, or volunteer applications. See [Managing Pages](../website/managing-pages.md) for how to add a form element to any page.

## You're Done!

Your church website is live. Share the URL with your congregation and on social media. You can update content, add new pages, and adjust the appearance at any time from the B1 Admin dashboard.
