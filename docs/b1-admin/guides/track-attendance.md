# Track Church Attendance

<div class="article-intro">

Set up attendance tracking for your services and groups — from configuring campuses and service times, to recording attendance manually or via the self-service check-in app, to viewing trends in reports. By the end, you'll have a complete picture of who's attending and when.

</div>

<div class="prereqs">
<h4>Before You Begin</h4>

- B1 Admin account with admin access
- [People added to your directory](../people/adding-people.md)
- [Groups created](../groups/creating-groups.md) for the ministries you want to track

</div>

## Step 1: Configure Campuses & Services

Define where and when your church meets.

Follow the [Attendance Setup](../attendance/setup.md) guide to:

1. Add your campus (e.g., "Main Campus")
2. Add service times (e.g., "Sunday 9:00 AM", "Sunday 11:00 AM", "Wednesday 7:00 PM")
3. Assign groups to each service time to define what classes/ministries meet during that service

## Step 2: Enable Group Attendance Tracking

Turn on attendance tracking for the groups you want to monitor.

Follow the [Creating Groups](../groups/creating-groups.md) guide to:

1. Edit each group you want to track and turn on "Track Attendance"
2. Associate groups with service times so attendance is recorded against the right service

:::info
Not every group needs attendance tracking. Enable it for groups where you want to monitor participation — children's classes, small groups, Sunday school, etc.
:::

## Step 3: Record Attendance Manually

Check off who attended each service and group.

Follow the [Tracking Attendance](../attendance/tracking-attendance.md) guide to:

1. Navigate to Attendance, select the date and service
2. Check off who attended each group

:::tip
Manual tracking works great for adult services, small groups, and any situation where a check-in kiosk isn't practical.
:::

## Step 4: Set Up Self Check-In (Optional)

Let members check themselves in using a tablet kiosk.

Follow the [Check-In](../attendance/check-in.md) guide to:

1. Install the B1 Checkin app on a tablet for self-service check-in
2. Members search for their name and check in themselves and their family
3. Check-in attendance records appear alongside manually entered records — no difference in the data

:::info
For a complete children's ministry setup including hardware and printer configuration, see the [Children's Check-In Guide](./childrens-checkin.md).
:::

## Step 5: View Attendance Reports

See the big picture of participation across your church.

Follow the [Attendance Reports](../reports/attendance-reports.md) guide. Three report views are available:

1. **Attendance Trend** — see attendance over time to spot growth or decline
2. **Group Attendance** — compare totals across groups
3. **Daily Group Attendance** — day-by-day breakdown for detailed analysis

:::info
Reports combine both manually recorded and self-check-in attendance. There's no difference in how the data appears — both methods feed into the same reports.
:::

## You're Done!

Your attendance tracking is set up. Whether you record attendance manually, use the check-in app, or both — all the data flows into the same reports so you have a clear picture of participation across your church.
