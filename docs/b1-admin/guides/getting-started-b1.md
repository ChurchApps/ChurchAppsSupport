</div>

## Step 1: Create Your Account

Register your church and become the first administrator.

Follow the [Create Account](../../getting-started/create-account.md) guide to:

1. Go to b1.church and register with your email
2. Verify your email address
3. Choose "Create a new church" and enter your church name
4. You automatically become the Domain Admin with full access to everything

## Step 2: Configure Church Settings

Enter your church's basic information and branding.

Follow the [Church Settings](../settings/church-settings.md) guide to:

1. Enter your church name, address, phone number, and email
2. Set your subdomain (this becomes yourchurch.b1.church)
3. Upload your church logo and images

:::tip
Your subdomain appears in your website URL and giving page URL, so choose something short and recognizable (e.g., "grace" for Grace Community Church).
:::

## Step 3: Set Up Roles & Invite Your Team

Control who has access to what and bring your team on board.

Follow the [Roles & Permissions](../settings/roles-permissions.md) guide to:

1. Create roles for your team (e.g., "Pastor", "Office Admin", "Finance Team", "Worship Leader")
2. Assign specific permissions to each role so people only see what they need
3. Invite team members by adding them and assigning roles

:::info
You don't have to do everything yourself. Invite your office staff, pastors, and ministry leaders early so they can help set up their areas.
:::

## Step 4: Import Your People

Bring your existing member directory into B1.

Follow the [Importing Data](../people/importing-data.md) guide. You have two options:

1. **CSV Upload** — export from your current system or spreadsheet, format as CSV, upload to B1
2. **Breeze Migration** — one-click import that brings over people, photos, groups, donations, and attendance

:::tip
Migrating from Breeze? The import tool brings everything over in one step — people, photos, groups, donations, and attendance history. It's the fastest way to get started.
:::

## Step 5: Configure the Mobile App

Customize the B1 Mobile app experience for your congregation.

Follow the [Mobile App Settings](../settings/mobile-app.md) guide to:

1. Customize which tabs appear in the B1 Mobile app for your members
2. Set tab names, icons, and types (Bible, Live Stream, Donation, Website, etc.)
3. Control which features are visible to your congregation

## Step 6: Start Setting Up Features

Now that your foundation is in place, follow these guides to set up specific features:

- [Set Up Online Giving](./online-giving.md) — accept donations through your website and app
- [Launch Your Church Website](./launch-website.md) — build your church website
- [Run Small Groups](./small-groups.md) — organize groups, Bible studies, and ministries
- [Set Up Children's Check-In](./childrens-checkin.md) — kiosk check-in for kids ministry
- [Manage Sunday Volunteers](./sunday-volunteers.md) — coordinate your serving teams
- [Build Your Sermon Library](./sermon-library.md) — get sermons online and set up live streaming
- [Track Attendance](./track-attendance.md) — monitor who's coming to services and groups

## You're Done!

Your church is set up on B1. Your team has access, your people are imported, and you're ready to start using the features that matter most to your ministry. Explore the feature guides above to set up each area.
