# Run Small Groups

<div class="article-intro">

Set up small groups, Bible studies, or ministry teams with member management, group calendars, and conversations. Publish a church-wide event calendar on your website so visitors can see what's happening and members can stay connected through the web portal and mobile app.

</div>

<div class="prereqs">
<h4>Before You Begin</h4>

- B1 Admin account with admin access
- [People added to your directory](../people/adding-people.md) (group members need to exist first)

</div>

## Step 1: Create Group Categories & Groups

Organize your groups into categories so members can easily find what they're looking for.

Follow the [Creating Groups](../groups/creating-groups.md) guide to:

1. Create categories to organize your groups (e.g., "Small Groups", "Bible Studies", "Ministry Teams", "Committees")
2. Create groups within each category (e.g., "Tuesday Night Men's Group", "Women's Bible Study", "Youth Ministry")
3. Add a description and meeting time for each group

## Step 2: Add Members & Leaders

Populate your groups with members and designate leaders who can manage their own teams.

Follow the [Group Members](../groups/group-members.md) guide to:

1. Search for people and add them to the appropriate groups
2. Designate group leaders using the green key icon — leaders get extra permissions

:::tip
Group leaders can manage their own group calendar, post conversations, and coordinate events without needing full admin access.
:::

## Step 3: Set Up Group Calendars

Give each group its own calendar for meetings and events.

Follow the [Group Calendar](../groups/group-calendar.md) guide to:

1. Add recurring meetings (e.g., "Every Tuesday at 7 PM") and one-time events (e.g., "Group Cookout - March 15")
2. Group leaders can add and manage events for their own group

## Step 4: Create a Church-Wide Calendar

Aggregate events from all your groups into one unified calendar for the whole church.

Follow the [Creating Calendars](../calendars/creating-calendars.md) and [Curated Calendar](../calendars/curated-calendar.md) guides to:

1. Create a curated calendar that pulls events from multiple groups into one unified view
2. Share the ICS subscription link so members can add events to their personal calendar apps (Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Outlook)

:::info
A curated calendar automatically aggregates events from the groups you connect. When a group leader adds an event, it shows up on the church calendar too.
:::

## Step 5: Publish to Your Website

Make your groups and calendar visible to visitors and members on your B1 website.

Follow the [Managing Pages](../website/managing-pages.md) guide to:

1. Add a Calendar section to your B1 website to display the curated calendar
2. Add a Groups section so visitors can browse available groups and learn how to join

## Step 6: Member Experience

Members can discover, join, and participate in groups from their phone or computer.

1. Members browse and join groups on [B1.church](../../b1-church/groups/browsing-groups.md)
2. Group members can view details, calendars, and post in [conversations](../../b1-church/groups/conversations.md)
3. All group features are also available on the [B1 Mobile app](../../b1-mobile/groups/)

:::info
Members see their groups, upcoming events, and group conversations on both web and mobile — everything stays in sync.
:::

## You're Done!

Your small groups are set up and connected. Members can discover groups, view events, and stay connected through conversations — all on your website and mobile app. Group leaders can manage their own teams independently.
