# Build Your Sermon Library & Live Stream

<div class="article-intro">

Get your sermon archive online and set up live streaming — from importing your existing YouTube or Vimeo library to scheduling recurring live services with interactive chat. By the end, your congregation can watch past sermons and join live services on your website and mobile app.

</div>

<div class="prereqs">
<h4>Before You Begin</h4>

- B1 Admin account with content management permission
- YouTube or Vimeo channel with sermon videos (for importing your archive)
- YouTube Channel ID (for live streaming — find it in your YouTube Studio settings)

</div>

## Step 1: Create Sermon Playlists

Playlists organize your sermons into series and collections for easy browsing.

Follow the [Playlists](../sermons/playlists.md) guide to:

1. Create series/collections like "2024 Sunday Messages", "Marriage Series", "Christmas Services"
2. Add a name, description, publish date, and thumbnail for each playlist

:::tip
Create playlists before adding sermons. This makes it easier to organize sermons into the right series as you add them.
:::

## Step 2: Import Your Existing Sermons

If you already have sermon videos on YouTube or Vimeo, you can pull them all in at once.

Follow the [Bulk Import](../sermons/bulk-import.md) guide to:

1. Enter your YouTube or Vimeo channel URL
2. Preview the import to see which videos will be pulled in
3. Click Import to add them all at once

:::tip
Enable auto-import and new videos you upload to YouTube/Vimeo will appear in B1 automatically — no manual work needed.
:::

## Step 3: Add Individual Sermons

For one-off additions or sermons not part of a bulk import, add them individually.

Follow the [Managing Sermons](../sermons/managing-sermons.md) guide to:

1. Paste a video URL (YouTube, Vimeo, or Facebook)
2. Title, description, thumbnail, and duration auto-fill from the video metadata
3. Assign the sermon to a playlist

## Step 4: Set Up Live Streaming

Connect your YouTube channel so your B1 site automatically picks up your live stream.

Follow the [Live Streaming](../sermons/live-streaming.md) guide to:

1. Enter your YouTube Channel ID in the streaming settings
2. Configure your recurring service schedule (e.g., Sundays at 10:00 AM)
3. Customize the streaming page tabs: Chat, Prayer requests, and custom links

:::info
When you go live on YouTube, the B1 streaming page automatically picks up the stream. No extra steps needed on Sunday morning.
:::

## Step 5: Display on Your Website

Make your sermon library and live stream easily accessible to visitors.

Follow the [Managing Pages](../website/managing-pages.md) guide to:

1. Add a Sermons section to your B1 website so visitors can browse your library
2. Add a Live Stream section for the live viewing experience

## Step 6: Mobile Access

Members can access sermons and live services from any device.

1. Members can watch sermons in the [B1 Mobile app](../../b1-mobile/content/sermons.md) and on [B1.church](../../b1-church/content/sermons.md)
2. Live streaming with chat and prayer requests works on both platforms

:::info
The live chat and prayer request features let your online congregation participate in real time, just like being in the room.
:::

## You're Done!

Your sermon library is online and your live stream is configured. Members can catch up on past sermons anytime and join live services from anywhere. New sermon uploads can sync automatically.
