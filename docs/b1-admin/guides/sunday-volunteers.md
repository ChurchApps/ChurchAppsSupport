# Manage Sunday Volunteers

<div class="article-intro">

Set up your volunteer teams, create weekly service plans, assign positions, build service orders with worship songs, and automate recurring tasks. By the end, your volunteers will see their assignments on the B1 website and mobile app, and can accept or decline directly.

<h4>Before You Begin</h4>

- B1 Admin account with admin access
- Volunteers [added to your people directory](../people/adding-people.md)

</div>

## Step 1: Create Volunteer Teams

Organize your volunteers into teams so you can manage assignments by ministry area.

Follow the [Creating Groups](../groups/creating-groups.md) and [Group Members](../groups/group-members.md) guides to:

1. Create a category (e.g., "Sunday Morning Teams")
2. Create groups like "Worship Team", "Sound & Media", "Greeters", "Kids Ministry Volunteers"
3. Add volunteers to each group by searching for their name and clicking Add

:::tip
Designate team leaders using the green key icon on the Members tab. Leaders can manage their own group calendar and coordinate their team.
:::

## Step 2: Build Your Song Library

Add worship songs so you can pull them into service plans each week.

Follow the [Songs](../serving/songs.md) guide to:

1. Add worship songs with titles, artists, and duration
2. For each song, add arrangements with lyrics and key designations
3. Add external links to YouTube performances, chord charts, or sheet music

:::info
Songs added here can be pulled into any service plan later. Build your library once, reuse it every week.
:::

## Step 3: Create a Service Plan

Plans are the weekly assignments that tell volunteers where they're needed.

Follow the [Plans](../serving/plans.md) guide to:

1. Navigate to Serving, select your ministry tab
2. Click "Add Plan" and pick the service date
3. On the Assignments tab, expand each team and assign volunteers to their positions
4. Volunteers will see their assignment status (Requested, Confirmed, Pending)

## Step 4: Build the Service Order

Lay out the flow of your service from start to finish.

Follow the [Service Order](../serving/service-order.md) guide to:

1. Switch to the "Service Order" tab in your plan
2. Click "Add Item" to add elements: worship songs (from your library), prayers, scripture readings, announcements, sermon, offering, closing
3. Drag and drop items to reorder the service flow

:::info
Service orders are plan-specific. Changes here don't affect other plans or the master song library.
:::

## Step 5: Set Up Recurring Tasks

Automate weekly responsibilities so nothing falls through the cracks.

Follow the [Tasks](../serving/tasks.md) and [Automations](../serving/automations.md) guides to:

1. Create automations for weekly recurring responsibilities (e.g., "Prepare communion elements", "Print bulletins", "Set up sound equipment")
2. Assign each automation to the responsible person or group
3. Tasks appear on their B1 dashboard and mobile app automatically

:::tip
Set automations to Inactive during holiday breaks or special seasons, then reactivate when you're ready. No need to delete and recreate.
:::

## Step 6: Let Volunteers Know

Assigned volunteers automatically see their plans and can respond.

1. Volunteers see their plans on [B1.church](../../b1-church/plans/viewing-plans.md) and the [B1 Mobile app](../../b1-mobile/serving/viewing-plans.md)
2. They can accept or decline assignments directly from either platform
3. They can set blockout dates for weeks they're unavailable
4. Plans can be printed for rehearsals or posted backstage

:::tip
Push notifications on the mobile app alert volunteers when they receive new assignments or when plans change.
:::

## You're Done!

Your volunteer management system is set up. Each week, create a new plan, assign positions, and your team sees everything on their phone or computer. Recurring tasks handle the routine prep work automatically.
