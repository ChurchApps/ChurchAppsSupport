# Donation Reports

<div class="article-intro">

B1 Admin gives you several ways to view and analyze your church's giving data. The Donations Summary page provides a visual overview with charts and filters, while the Reports section offers a more detailed Donation Summary report. Use these tools to track giving trends, prepare for board meetings, or reconcile your records.

</div>

<div class="prereqs">
<h4>Before You Begin</h4>

- Ensure donations have been [recorded in batches](recording-donations.md) or [imported from Stripe](stripe-import.md)
- Verify that your [funds](funds.md) are set up correctly so donations are properly categorized

</div>

## Donations Summary Page

The **Summary** page is the first thing you see when you click **Donations** in the sidebar. It provides a high-level view of your giving activity.

1. Navigate to **Donations** in the sidebar to open the Summary page.
2. Use the **date range filter** to select the time period you want to review. Set the earlier date on top and the more recent date on the bottom.
3. The page displays a weekly giving chart so you can see trends at a glance.
4. Click **Download** to export a CSV file with the total amount given, the week it was given, and the fund it was given to.

:::info
The Summary page shows aggregate giving data. It does not include individual donor names. For donor-level details, use the [Batches](batches.md) page.

## Viewing Donor-Level Details

For a breakdown of who gave, how much, and to which fund:

2. Click on a **batch name** to open it.
3. The batch detail page lists each donation with the donor's name, amount, fund, date, and payment method.
4. Click on a **donor's name** to see a breakdown of how many times they donated and how much each time.
5. Click on a **donation ID** to open a side panel with the full details for that individual donation.

## Donation Summary Report

B1 Admin also includes a **Donation Summary** report in the Reports section:

## Exporting Data

You can export donation data from multiple places:

:::tip
For year-end reporting, combine the Summary page export with the [Giving Statements](giving-statements.md) tool to get both aggregate trends and individual donor statements.
