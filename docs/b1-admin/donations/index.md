# Donations

The Donations section in B1 Admin provides everything you need to manage your church's giving. From recording weekly offerings to generating year-end tax statements, all of your donation tools are organized in one place.

## Sub-Sections

You will find the following pages in the Donations sidebar:

### Summary

The **Summary** page gives you a visual overview of all giving activity. It displays charts and filtered reports so you can quickly see donation trends across your church.

### Batches

**Batches** let you group donations together -- for example, all the checks and cash collected during a Sunday offering. Each batch tracks its donation count and total amount for easy reconciliation.

### Funds

**Funds** categorize your donations by purpose. Common examples include General Fund, Building Fund, and Missions. You can mark each fund as tax-deductible or not.

### Statements

The **Statements** page generates year-end giving statements for your donors. You can download individual CSV files or print all statements at once.

### Stripe Import

If you accept online donations through Stripe, the **Stripe Import** tool lets you pull those transactions into B1 Admin so everything is in one system.

## Online Giving

B1 Admin integrates with **Stripe** and **PayPal** for accepting online donations. Once configured, members can give through your B1.church site and those donations automatically appear in your records.
