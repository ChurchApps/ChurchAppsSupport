# Donations

<div class="article-intro">

The Donations section in B1 Admin provides everything you need to manage your church's giving. From recording weekly offerings to generating year-end tax statements, all of your donation tools are organized in one place so you can stay on top of your church's finances.

</div>

## Sub-Sections

You will find the following pages in the Donations sidebar:

### Summary

The **Summary** page gives you a visual overview of all giving activity. It displays charts and filtered reports so you can quickly see donation trends across your church. See [Donation Reports](donation-reports.md) for more details on using the summary and report tools.

### Batches

**[Batches](batches.md)** let you group donations together -- for example, all the checks and cash collected during a Sunday offering. Each batch tracks its donation count and total amount for easy reconciliation.

### Funds

**[Funds](funds.md)** categorize your donations by purpose. Common examples include General Fund, Building Fund, and Missions. You can mark each fund as tax-deductible or not.

### Statements

The **[Statements](giving-statements.md)** page generates year-end giving statements for your donors. You can download individual CSV files or print all statements at once.

### Stripe Import

If you accept online donations through Stripe, the **[Stripe Import](stripe-import.md)** tool lets you pull those transactions into B1 Admin so everything is in one system.

## Online Giving

B1 Admin integrates with **Stripe** and **PayPal** for accepting online donations. Once configured, members can give through your B1.church site and those donations automatically appear in your records. See [Online Giving Setup](online-giving-setup.md) to get started.

:::tip
If you are new to donations in B1 Admin, start by [setting up your funds](funds.md), then [create your first batch](batches.md) and [record donations](recording-donations.md) into it.
