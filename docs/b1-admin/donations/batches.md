# Donation Batches

Batches group your donations together for easier tracking and reconciliation. A typical batch represents a single collection, such as a Sunday offering or a special event. Using batches helps you stay organized and makes it simple to verify that your records match the actual deposits.

## The Batches Page

When you navigate to **Donations > Batches**, you will see a list of all your batches. Each row displays:

- **Name** -- the label you gave the batch
- **Date** -- the date of the collection
- **Donations** -- the number of individual donations in the batch
- **Total** -- the combined dollar amount

The header at the top shows summary statistics including the total number of batches, the total number of donations across all batches, and the overall dollar amount.

## Creating a New Batch

1. Click **Add Batch** at the top of the page.
2. Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "Sunday Offering - Feb 9").
3. Select the date of the collection.
4. Click **Save**.

Your new batch appears in the list, ready for you to add donations.

## Working with Batches

- **View donations** -- click a batch name to open it and see all the individual donations it contains. From there you can add, edit, or remove donations.
- **Edit batch details** -- click the **Edit** button on a batch row to change its name or date.
- **Sort** -- use the column headers to sort batches by name or date.
- **Export** -- click **Export to CSV** to download your batch list as a spreadsheet.

:::tip
Name your batches consistently so they are easy to find later. Including the date and collection type (e.g., "Sunday AM - 2025-02-09") keeps your list organized as it grows.
