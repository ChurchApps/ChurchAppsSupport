# Recording Donations

<div class="article-intro">

Recording donations in B1 Admin is done through the Batches system. You create a batch to represent a collection (such as a Sunday offering), then add individual donations to that batch. This keeps your giving records organized and easy to reconcile.

</div>

<div class="prereqs">
<h4>Before You Begin</h4>

- Set up your [funds](funds.md) so you can assign donations to the correct categories
- Create a [batch](batches.md) to hold the donations you are about to enter
- Make sure the donors are in your [people directory](../people/adding-people.md) so you can look them up when entering gifts

</div>

## Creating a Batch and Adding Donations

1. In **B1 Admin**, click **Donations** in the sidebar, then click **Batches**.
2. Click **Add Batch**.
3. Enter a name for the batch (e.g., "Sunday Offering - Jan 5") and select the date. Click **Save**.
4. Your new batch appears in the list showing zero donations and $0.00.
5. Click on the **batch name** to open it.

## Entering Individual Donations

1. In the batch detail page, type the donor's name in the **search field** to find them.
2. After selecting a person, the donation entry form appears with fields for **Date**, **Payment Method**, **Fund**, **Amount**, and **Check Number**.
3. Fill in the details and click **Add Donation**.
4. The donation is added to the table below, and the form resets so you can enter the next one.

:::tip
You can quickly enter multiple donations in a row without leaving the batch page. The form resets after each entry so you can move through a stack of checks or envelopes efficiently.

## Splitting a Donation Across Multiple Funds

Sometimes a single donor gives to more than one fund in one transaction. To handle this:

1. Click the **Edit** button on the donation row.
2. In the edit form, add amounts to different funds. The total will automatically calculate from the individual fund amounts.
3. Click **Save** to update the donation.

:::info
Splitting donations across funds is common when a donor writes a single check designated for multiple purposes, such as General Fund and Missions.
:::

## Editing or Removing Donations

To edit a donation, click the **Edit** button on its row in the batch. You can change the date, amount, fund, payment method, or any other detail. Click **Save** when you are done.

:::tip
The batch page header updates automatically to show the total number of donations and the combined dollar amount as you add or edit entries. Use this to reconcile against your deposit slip.

## Next Steps
