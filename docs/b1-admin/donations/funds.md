# Managing Funds

<div class="article-intro">

Funds let you categorize donations by purpose so you can track how much your church receives for each area of ministry. Common funds include General Fund, Building Fund, Missions, and Youth Ministry, but you can create as many as you need.

</div>

<div class="prereqs">
<h4>Before You Begin</h4>

- You will need access to the **Donations** section in B1 Admin
- Decide which giving categories your church needs and whether each should be tax-deductible

</div>

## The Funds Page

Navigate to **Donations > Funds** to see a list of all your funds. Each row shows the fund name and its **tax-deductible** status, which determines whether donations to that fund appear on year-end [giving statements](giving-statements.md).

## Creating a New Fund

1. Click **Add Fund** at the top of the page.
2. Enter a name for the fund (e.g., "Building Fund").
3. Check the **Tax Deductible** box if donations to this fund should be included on giving statements.
4. Click **Save**.

The new fund immediately appears in your list and is available when entering donations.

## Editing and Deleting Funds

- To edit a fund, click the **Edit** button next to it. You can change the name or toggle the tax-deductible setting.
- To delete a fund, open the edit form and click **Delete**.

:::warning
Deleting a fund does not remove donations that were previously assigned to it. Those donation records remain in the system, but the fund will no longer be available for new donations.
:::

## Viewing Fund Details

Click on a **fund name** to open its detail page. This page shows:

- **Donation history** -- a list of all donations to this fund
- **Date range filter** -- narrow the results to a specific time period
- **Summary statistics** -- total donations, unique donors, and total dollar amount

This view is helpful when you need to report on a specific giving initiative or check progress toward a fundraising goal.

## Sorting and Exporting

- Use the column headers to sort funds by name.
- Click **Export to CSV** to download your fund list as a spreadsheet.

:::tip
Set up your funds before you start [recording donations](recording-donations.md). Having all funds in place ensures donations are categorized correctly from the start.
:::

## Next Steps

Once your funds are set up, you can assign them to donations when [recording donations](recording-donations.md) in a batch. Make sure to mark the appropriate funds as tax-deductible before generating [giving statements](giving-statements.md).
