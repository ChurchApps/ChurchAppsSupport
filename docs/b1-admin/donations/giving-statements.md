# Giving Statements

At the end of each year, your donors need a summary of their tax-deductible giving for their records. B1 Admin makes it easy to generate these statements for all donors at once.

## Accessing Giving Statements

1. In **B1 Admin**, click **Donations** in the sidebar.
2. Click **Statements**.

## Generating Statements

1. Select the **year** from the dropdown at the top of the page. You can choose the current year or any of the five previous years.
2. The page displays summary statistics for that year, including:
   - **Total donors** -- the number of people who gave
   - **Total donations** -- the number of individual donation records
   - **Total amount** -- the combined dollar amount of all giving

## Downloading Statements

You have two options for getting statements to your donors:

### Download as CSV Files

Click **Download ZIP** to download a ZIP file containing an individual CSV file for each donor. This is useful if you want to email statements individually or import them into another system.

### Print All Statements

Click **Print All** to open a printable view of every donor's statement in your browser. From there, use your browser's print function to send them to a printer. Each statement starts on a new page so they are ready to fold and mail.

:::tip
Run your statements early in January while your records are fresh. Double-check that your funds are correctly marked as tax-deductible before generating statements -- only donations to tax-deductible funds are included.
:::

:::info
Giving statements only include donations assigned to funds that have the **Tax Deductible** setting enabled. If a fund is not marked as tax-deductible, its donations will not appear on the statement. You can manage this setting on the [Funds](funds.md) page.
