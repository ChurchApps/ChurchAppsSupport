# Check-In

<div class="article-intro">

B1 Admin supports self check-in at services through the companion **B1 Checkin** app. Members can check themselves and their families in at kiosks or dedicated devices when they arrive, making the process fast and reducing the workload on your volunteers. Every check-in is automatically recorded as attendance.

<div class="prereqs">
<h4>Before You Begin</h4>

- Your campuses, service times, and groups must be configured in [Attendance Setup](setup.md).
- You need [people in your database](../people/adding-people.md) with [households](../people/adding-people.md#managing-households) set up so families can check in together.
- You'll need a tablet and optionally a Brother label printer (see [hardware recommendations](#recommended-hardware) below).

## How It Works

The B1 Checkin app connects to your B1 Admin attendance setup. When a member checks in, their attendance is automatically recorded against the correct campus, service time, and group. You do not need to enter attendance manually for anyone who uses the check-in system.

## Setting Up Check-In

1. **Configure your attendance structure first.** In B1 Admin, go to **Attendance > Setup** and make sure your campuses, service times, and groups are in place. The check-in app relies on this configuration. See [Attendance Setup](setup.md) for details.
2. **Install the B1 Checkin app** on the devices you plan to use. The app is available on the following platforms:
   - **Android/Samsung Tablets:** [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=church.b1.checkin)
   - **Amazon Fire Tablets:** [Amazon App Store](https://www.amazon.com/Live-Church-Solutions-B1-Check-In/dp/B0FW5HKRB5/)
3. **Sign in to the B1 Checkin app** using your church's account credentials.
4. **Select the campus and service time** for the current gathering.
5. Members can now search for their name on the device and check in.

:::tip
Place check-in devices in visible, easy-to-reach locations such as lobby entrances or welcome desks. A brief announcement during services helps members know the option is available.

:::tip
If your church has multiple campuses, you'll need to repeat the setup for each campus in [Attendance Setup](setup.md). Each check-in device can be configured for a different campus.

## Recommended Hardware

**Tablets** — any of these work well with the app:

- **Compact:** Samsung Galaxy Tab A7 Lite 8.7"
- **Large Screen:** Samsung Galaxy Tab A8 10.5"
- **Budget:** Amazon Fire HD 10

**Printers** — check-ins work with Brother label printers for printing name tags:

- **Best:** Brother QL-1110NWB (supports multiple tablets via Bluetooth and WiFi)
- **Good:** Brother QL-810W (supports multiple tablets via WiFi)
- **Budget:** Brother QL-1100 (WiFi only)

**Labels:** Brother DK-1201 (1-1/7" x 3-1/2")

:::warning
Only Brother label printers are compatible with the B1 Checkin app. Other printer brands will not work for printing name tags.
:::

:::info
Follow your printer's setup instructions to connect it to the same WiFi network as your tablet. You can find Brother printer drivers and setup guides on the [Brother support site](https://support.brother.com).

## What Gets Recorded

Every check-in creates an attendance record in B1 Admin. You can view these records on the [Attendance](tracking-attendance.md) and [Groups](../groups/group-members.md) tabs just like manually entered attendance. There is no difference in how the data appears — both methods feed into the same reports.
