# Attendance Setup

Before you can track attendance, you need to tell B1 Admin about your church's physical locations, when services happen, and which groups meet at each service. This page walks you through that process.

## Key Concepts

- **Campus** -- a physical location where your church meets (e.g., "Main Campus," "North Campus").
- **Service Time** -- a recurring gathering at a campus (e.g., "Sunday 9:00 AM," "Wednesday 7:00 PM").
- **Scheduled Group** -- a group assigned to a specific service time. Attendance is tracked in the context of that service.
- **Unscheduled Group** -- a group that tracks attendance on its own, without being tied to a service time.

## Setting Up Your Attendance Structure

1. Open **B1 Admin** and click **Attendance** in the sidebar.
2. Select the **Setup** tab.
3. Click **Add Campus** and enter the name of your location. Click **Save**.
4. With your campus selected, click **Add Service Time**. Enter a name such as "Sunday 9:00 AM" and click **Save**.
5. Repeat for each service time at that campus.
6. To assign a group to a service time, select the service time and click **Add Group**. Choose the group from the list and click **Save**.

:::tip
If a group meets outside of a regular service -- like a midweek small group that tracks its own attendance -- you can leave it as an unscheduled group. It will still appear on the Groups tab for attendance reporting.

## Editing Your Setup

You can update your setup at any time. Select a campus, service time, or group and click **Edit** to change its details, or **Delete** to remove it. Removing a service time does not delete past attendance records.

## What's Next

Once your campuses, service times, and groups are in place, you are ready to start [tracking attendance](tracking-attendance.md) or set up [self check-in](check-in.md) for your services.
