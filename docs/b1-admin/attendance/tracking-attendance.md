# Tracking Attendance

Once your campuses, service times, and groups are configured, B1 Admin makes it easy to review attendance data and spot trends. The Attendance page provides two reporting views -- the **Attendance** tab for church-wide trends and the **Groups** tab for group-level detail.

## Viewing Attendance Trends

1. Open **B1 Admin** and click **Attendance** in the sidebar.
2. Select the **Attendance** tab.
3. The report runs automatically when the tab opens, showing attendance over a default date range.

## Filtering Your Data

Use the filters at the top of the page to narrow the results:

- **Date Range** -- choose a start and end date to focus on a specific period.
- **Campus** -- select a campus to see attendance for only that location.
- **Service Time** -- pick a service time to drill into a particular gathering.

The chart and data update as soon as you change a filter, so you can quickly compare different time periods or locations.

Reports auto-run each time you open the Attendance tab, so you will always see up-to-date numbers without needing to click a refresh button.

## Group Attendance

The **Groups** tab shows attendance broken down by individual group. This is useful when you want to monitor a specific class, ministry team, or small group rather than looking at overall service numbers.

1. Select the **Groups** tab.
2. Choose a group from the list to see its attendance history.
3. Use the date range filter to adjust the reporting window.

## Tips for Using Attendance Data

- Review trends monthly to catch seasonal patterns early.
- Compare campus-level data to understand which locations are growing.
- Use group-level reports to follow up with groups that show declining attendance.
