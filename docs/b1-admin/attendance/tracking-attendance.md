# Tracking Attendance

<div class="article-intro">

Once your campuses, service times, and groups are configured, B1 Admin makes it easy to review attendance data and spot trends. The Attendance page provides two reporting views -- the **Attendance** tab for church-wide trends and the **Groups** tab for group-level detail. Use these tools to understand growth patterns, identify declining engagement, and make data-driven decisions for your church.

<div class="prereqs">
<h4>Before You Begin</h4>

- Your attendance structure must be set up with at least one campus and service time. See [Attendance Setup](setup.md) if you haven't done this yet.
- Attendance data needs to be recorded before reports will show results. Data can come from manual entry or [self check-in](check-in.md).

</div>

## Viewing Attendance Trends

1. Open **B1 Admin** and click **Attendance** in the sidebar.
2. Select the **Attendance** tab.
3. The report runs automatically when the tab opens, showing attendance over a default date range.

## Filtering Your Data

Use the filters at the top of the page to narrow the results:

- **Date Range** -- choose a start and end date to focus on a specific period.
- **Campus** -- select a campus to see attendance for only that location.
- **Service Time** -- pick a service time to drill into a particular gathering.

The chart and data update as soon as you change a filter, so you can quickly compare different time periods or locations.

:::info
Reports auto-run each time you open the Attendance tab, so you will always see up-to-date numbers without needing to click a refresh button.
:::

## Group Attendance

The **Groups** tab shows attendance broken down by individual group. This is useful when you want to monitor a specific class, ministry team, or small group rather than looking at overall service numbers.

1. Select the **Groups** tab.
2. Choose a group from the list to see its attendance history.
3. Use the date range filter to adjust the reporting window.

:::tip
Group attendance is especially valuable for [small group](../groups/creating-groups.md) leaders who want to track engagement within their group over time.

## Tips for Using Attendance Data

- Review trends monthly to catch seasonal patterns early.
- Compare campus-level data to understand which locations are growing.
- Use group-level reports to follow up with [groups](../groups/group-members.md) that show declining attendance.
- Combine attendance insights with the [AI Search](../people/ai-search.md) tool to find people who haven't attended recently.
