# Attendance

<div class="article-intro">

The Attendance section in B1 Admin gives you a complete view of who is showing up at your church and how your groups are growing over time. From configuring campuses and service times to reviewing trends and setting up self check-in, everything you need to track and understand attendance is managed from this page.

</div>

## Page Overview

When you open the Attendance page, you will see a header with key statistics about your church's attendance setup:

- **Campuses** -- the number of physical locations you have configured
- **Service Times** -- the total number of services across all campuses
- **Scheduled Groups** -- groups that are assigned to a specific service time
- **Unscheduled Groups** -- groups that track attendance independently of a service time

Below the header, three tabs organize your attendance tools.

## Tabs

### Setup

The **Setup** tab is where you configure the building blocks of attendance tracking. Here you define your campuses, add service times to each campus, and assign [groups](../groups/creating-groups.md) to those service times. You only need to do this once, though you can update it whenever your schedule changes. See [Attendance Setup](setup.md) for a full walkthrough.

### Attendance

The **Attendance** tab displays attendance trends over time. Use the filters to narrow results by date range, campus, or service time and quickly spot patterns in your data. See [Tracking Attendance](tracking-attendance.md) for details on using reports and filters.

### Groups

The **Groups** tab breaks attendance down by individual group. This is helpful when you want to see how a specific small group, class, or ministry team is doing rather than looking at church-wide numbers.

## Next Steps

- [Attendance Setup](setup.md) -- configure campuses, service times, and groups
- [Tracking Attendance](tracking-attendance.md) -- view trends and filter reports
- [Check-In](check-in.md) -- set up self check-in for services

:::tip
If you are setting up attendance for the first time, start with the [Attendance Setup](setup.md) guide to define your campuses and service times. Once that is in place, you can begin tracking and reviewing attendance data right away.
