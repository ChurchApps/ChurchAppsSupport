# Managing Submissions

<div class="article-intro">

Once your form is live, submissions will start coming in. The Submissions tab lets you review every response, track who has submitted, and use the data to follow up with your congregation in a timely manner.

</div>

<div class="prereqs">
<h4>Before You Begin</h4>

- [Create a form](./creating-forms.md) with at least one question
- Share the form via its public URL or embed it on your [website](../website/managing-pages.md)

</div>

## Viewing Submissions

1. Navigate to **Forms** from the main menu.
2. Click on the form you want to review.
3. Go to the **Submissions** tab.

You will see a list of all responses received for that form. Each submission shows the respondent's information and the date it was submitted.

## Reviewing Individual Submissions

Click on any submission to view the full details. You will see all the answers the person provided for each question on the form.

## How Submissions Are Collected

Submissions can come in through several channels:

- **Public URL** -- If your form has a public URL (Stand Alone forms), anyone with the link can submit a response. Share the URL via email, social media, or text messages.
- **Embedded on your website** -- Forms embedded on your B1 website collect submissions automatically when visitors fill them out.
- **Internal use** -- Staff and volunteers can also submit forms on behalf of others directly within B1 Admin.

:::tip
Check the **Submissions** tab regularly for forms like visitor cards or prayer requests, so you can follow up promptly.

## Using Submission Data

The data collected through forms can help you:

- Track event registrations and plan accordingly
- Follow up with visitors or new members
- Collect survey feedback for ministry planning
- Process payments for events or programs

:::info
Form members with **Admin** or **View Only** roles can access the Submissions tab. Make sure the right people on your team have access to the forms they need by managing roles in the **Members** tab.

## Next Steps

- Learn how to build and customize forms in [Creating Forms](./creating-forms.md)
- Add people from form submissions to your [people directory](../people/adding-people.md) for ongoing follow-up
