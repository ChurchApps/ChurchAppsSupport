2. Click **Add Form**.
3. Enter a **name** for your form.

   - **People** -- Associates submissions with people records in your database.
   - **Stand Alone** -- Creates an independent form with its own public URL, ideal for external registrations.
5. Click **Save** to create the form.

Your new form will appear in the list. Click on it to start adding questions.

## Adding Questions

1. Open your form and go to the **Questions** tab.
2. Click **Add Question**.
3. Select a **field type** from the Provider dropdown. Available types include:
   - **Textbox** -- For short text answers
   - **Date** -- For date selections

   - **Multiple Choice** -- For selecting from predefined options
   - **Payment** -- For collecting payments
4. Enter a **Title** and optional **Description** for the question.
5. Check **Require an answer** if the field is mandatory.
6. Click **Save**.
7. Repeat to add more questions.

## Managing Form Members

1. Open your form and go to the **Members** tab.
2. Search for a person and add them with a role:
   - **Admin** -- Can edit the form and view all submissions.
   - **View Only** -- Can view submissions but cannot edit the form.

## Configuring Form Properties

You can update your form's name and settings at any time. For Stand Alone forms, you will also see a unique **public URL** that you can share with anyone.

Stand Alone forms are great for event registrations. Share the public URL via email, social media, or embed the form directly on your church website.
