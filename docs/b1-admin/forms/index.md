# Forms

<div class="article-intro">

The Forms section lets you create custom forms for registrations, surveys, data collection, and more. Whether you need a visitor card, an event sign-up, or a prayer request form, you can build it here and share it with your congregation through a public link or your B1.church website.

</div>

## The Forms Page

When you open **Forms**, you will see two tabs:

- **Forms** -- Shows all your active forms.
- **Archived** -- Shows forms that have been archived. You can restore archived forms at any time.

Each form in the list displays its name and, if configured, a public URL that you can share externally.

## What You Can Do

From the Forms page, you can:

- **Add a form** -- Click **Add Form** to create a new custom form.
- **Edit a form** -- Click on a form name to open it and modify its questions, members, or settings.
- **Archive a form** -- Move forms you no longer need to the **Archived** tab to keep your list clean.
- **Restore a form** -- Switch to the **Archived** tab and restore any form you want to make active again.

## Working with a Form

Click on any form name to open it. The form editor has three tabs:

- **Questions** -- Build the form structure by adding fields with different types. See [Creating Forms](./creating-forms.md) for details.
- **Members** -- Control who can access and manage the form.
- **Submissions** -- View responses that have been submitted. See [Managing Submissions](./managing-submissions.md) for details.

:::tip
Forms with a public URL can be shared via link, embedded on your website, or included in emails. This makes it easy to collect information from people who may not have a church account.

You can control who has access to each form using the **Members** tab. Assign **Admin** or **View Only** roles to give your team the right level of access.
