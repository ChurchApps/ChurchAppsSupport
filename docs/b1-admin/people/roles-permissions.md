# Assigning Roles

B1 Admin uses a role-based permission system to control what each user on your team can see and do. By assigning roles, you can give staff and volunteers access to exactly the areas they need -- and nothing more.

## Understanding Roles

A role is a set of permissions that you assign to one or more users. For example, you might create a "Finance Team" role that grants access to donation records, or a "Check-In Volunteer" role that only allows access to attendance features.

Each role controls access to specific areas of B1 Admin, including:

- **People** -- viewing and editing member profiles
- **Donations** -- managing contributions and financial reports
- **Attendance** -- recording and viewing attendance data
- **Forms** -- creating and managing custom forms
- **Groups** -- managing group memberships and calendars
- **Settings** -- configuring church-wide settings

:::note
**Domain Admins** have full access to every area of B1 Admin. Their permissions cannot be edited or restricted. Use this role only for your primary administrators.

## Viewing and Managing Roles

1. Click **Settings** in the left sidebar.
2. Click **Roles** in the top navigation.
3. You will see a list of all roles configured for your church.
4. Click on any role to view its members and permissions.

## Adding Users to a Role

1. Navigate to **Settings** then **Roles**.
2. Click the role you want to add a user to.
3. In the **Members** section, search for the person by name.
4. Click **Add** to assign them to the role.

The user will now have all permissions associated with that role the next time they log in.

## Editing Role Permissions

1. Navigate to **Settings** then **Roles**.
2. Click the role you want to modify.
3. In the **Permissions** section, check or uncheck the areas you want the role to access.
4. Click **Save** to apply your changes.

:::tip
Follow the principle of least privilege -- give each role only the permissions it truly needs. This keeps your data secure and reduces the chance of accidental changes.
