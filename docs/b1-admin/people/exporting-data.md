# Exporting Data

<div class="article-intro">

B1 Admin lets you export your church data so you can use it in spreadsheets, share it with your team, or keep a backup. Whether you need a quick list of names and emails or a complete database export, there are options to fit your needs.

</div>

<div class="prereqs">
<h4>Before You Begin</h4>

- You need an active B1 Admin account with permission to view the data you want to export. See [Roles & Permissions](roles-permissions.md) if you're unsure about your access level.
- For a full database export, you need access to the **Settings** area.

</div>

## Exporting from the People Page

The fastest way to export your directory is directly from the **People** page:

1. Navigate to **People** in the left sidebar.
2. Use the search bar or filters to narrow down the results you want to export (or leave it unfiltered to export everyone). See [Searching People](searching-people.md) for tips on filtering.
3. Use the **column selector** to choose which columns you want included in the export (for example, Name, Email, Phone, Address).
4. Click the **Export** button.
5. A CSV file will download to your computer with the data currently shown in the table.

:::tip
Customize your columns before exporting. The CSV file will include exactly the columns you have visible, so you can tailor the export to your needs without editing the file afterward.

## Full Data Export from Settings

For a complete export of all your B1 data (not just people), use the export tool in Settings:

1. Click **Settings** in the left sidebar.
2. Click **Import/Export** in the top navigation.
3. Select **B1 Database** from the **Data Source** dropdown.
4. Review the data preview and click **Continue to Destination**.
5. Select **B1 Export Zip** as the export destination.
6. Monitor the export progress until all items show green checkmarks.
7. The export file will download automatically. Look for the `B1Export` file in your downloads folder.
8. Unzip the file to access individual CSV files (such as `people.csv`) that you can open in Excel, Google Sheets, or Numbers.

:::info
Full data exports include people, groups, donations, attendance, and more -- everything in your B1 database. This is also a great way to create a periodic backup of your church records.

## Exporting Group Data

You can also export member lists for individual groups. From the **Groups** page, open a group and click the **download icon** to export that group's member list. See [Group Members](../groups/group-members.md) for more details.

:::info
Exported CSV files work with all major spreadsheet applications including Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, and Apple Numbers.
