# AI Search

<div class="article-intro">

The **AI Search** feature lets you search your church directory using plain, natural language questions instead of traditional search fields and filters. Rather than building a query with specific filter criteria, you can simply describe what you are looking for in everyday language -- making it fast to answer complex questions about your congregation.

<h4>Before You Begin</h4>

- You need an active B1 Admin account with permission to view people. See [Roles & Permissions](roles-permissions.md) if you're unsure about your access level.
- Familiarity with the standard [Searching People](searching-people.md) tools is helpful but not required.

</div>

## How It Works

AI Search uses artificial intelligence to interpret your question and return the matching results from your people database. You can ask questions the way you would ask a colleague.

1. Navigate to the **People** page in B1 Admin.
2. Look for the **AI Search** option under the search controls.
3. Type your question in plain language.
4. Press **Enter** or click **Search** to run your query.
5. The results table will update to show the matching people.

## Example Queries

Here are some examples of the kinds of questions you can ask:

- "Who hasn't attended in the last 3 months?"
- "Show me all members under 30"
- "List families with children in the youth group"
- "Who joined the church this year?"
- "Show me everyone without an email address"
- "Which members live in the 75001 zip code?"

:::tip
Be as specific as you can in your question. The more detail you provide, the more accurate your results will be.

## When to Use AI Search

AI Search is especially helpful when:

- You need to combine multiple criteria that would be difficult to set up with traditional filters.
- You are not sure exactly which fields to search by.
- You want a quick answer to a question about your congregation without building a report.

:::info
AI Search works alongside the standard quick search and column filters. Use whichever approach fits your needs best. For simple name lookups, the [quick search](searching-people.md) is the fastest option. For more nuanced questions, AI Search shines.
