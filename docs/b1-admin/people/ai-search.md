# AI Search

The **AI Search** feature lets you search your church directory using plain, natural language questions instead of traditional search fields and filters. Rather than building a query with specific filter criteria, you can simply describe what you are looking for in everyday language.

## How It Works

AI Search uses artificial intelligence to interpret your question and return the matching results from your people database. You can ask questions the way you would ask a colleague.

1. Navigate to the **People** page in B1 Admin.
2. Look for the **AI Search** option under the search controls.
3. Type your question in plain language.
4. Press **Enter** or click **Search** to run your query.
5. The results table will update to show the matching people.

## Example Queries

Here are some examples of the kinds of questions you can ask:

- "Who hasn't attended in the last 3 months?"
- "Show me all members under 30"
- "List families with children in the youth group"
- "Who joined the church this year?"
- "Show me everyone without an email address"
- "Which members live in the 75001 zip code?"

:::tip
Be as specific as you can in your question. The more detail you provide, the more accurate your results will be.

## When to Use AI Search

AI Search is especially helpful when:

- You need to combine multiple criteria that would be difficult to set up with traditional filters.
- You are not sure exactly which fields to search by.
- You want a quick answer to a question about your congregation without building a report.

AI Search works alongside the standard quick search and column filters. Use whichever approach fits your needs best. For simple name lookups, quick search is the fastest option. For more nuanced questions, AI Search shines.
