# Searching People

The **People** page displays your church directory in a searchable, sortable table. You can quickly find anyone in your congregation, customize which information is shown, and export your results.

## Quick Search

The search bar at the top of the People page lets you find members in real time:

1. Click the **search box** at the top of the People page.
2. Start typing a name, email, or other keyword.
3. Results will filter automatically as you type (there is a brief delay of about half a second so the search does not fire on every keystroke).
4. The table below updates to show only the matching results.

:::tip
You do not need to press Enter. The search runs automatically after you stop typing.

## Sorting Results

You can sort the directory by clicking any column header in the table:

1. Click a **column header** (for example, **Name** or **Email**) to sort by that column.
2. Click the same header again to reverse the sort order.

This makes it easy to find people alphabetically, by age, or by any other visible column.

## Customizing Columns

Not every piece of information needs to be visible at once. You can choose which columns appear in the table:

1. Look for the **column selector dropdown** near the top of the table.
2. Check or uncheck columns to show or hide them. Available columns include:
   - **Photo**
   - **Name**
   - **Email**
   - **Phone**
   - **Address**
   - **Birth Date**
   - **Age**
   - **Gender**
   - **Membership Status**
3. The table updates immediately to reflect your selections.

Your column choices affect what is included when you export to CSV. Customize columns before exporting to get exactly the data you need.

## Exporting Search Results

You can download your current search results as a CSV file at any time:

1. Apply any search or filters you want.
2. Customize your columns to include the data you need.
3. Click the **Export** button.
4. A CSV file will download to your computer, ready to open in Excel, Google Sheets, or any spreadsheet application.
