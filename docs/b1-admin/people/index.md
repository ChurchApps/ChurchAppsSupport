# People

<div class="article-intro">

The **People** section is the heart of your church management in B1 Admin. This is where you maintain your church directory -- searching for members, adding new people, viewing and editing profiles, and tracking households. Whether you have a small congregation or a large one, keeping your people records organized is the foundation that powers every other feature in B1.

## What You Can Do

Here is an overview of the key features available in the People section:

1. **Search your directory** -- Use the quick search bar to find anyone by name, or take advantage of advanced filters and AI-powered natural language search to locate exactly who you need. See [Searching People](./searching-people.md) and [AI Search](./ai-search.md) for details.

2. **Add new people** -- Quickly add individuals to your directory and fill in their profile details, contact information, and household connections. See [Adding People](./adding-people.md) for step-by-step instructions.

3. **Import and export data** -- Bring in member data from a CSV file or migrate from another church management system like Breeze. You can also export your directory to CSV at any time. See [Importing Data](./importing-data.md) and [Exporting Data](./exporting-data.md).

4. **Manage profiles** -- View and edit detailed profiles for each person, including contact info, household members, [group memberships](../groups/group-members.md), [attendance history](../attendance/tracking-attendance.md), [donations](../donations/recording-donations.md), and [custom forms](../forms/creating-forms.md).

5. **Assign roles and permissions** -- Control who on your team can access different parts of B1 Admin by assigning roles. See [Assigning Roles](./roles-permissions.md).
