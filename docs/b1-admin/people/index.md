# People

The **People** section is the heart of your church management in B1 Admin. This is where you maintain your church directory -- searching for members, adding new people, viewing and editing profiles, and tracking households.

Whether you have a small congregation or a large one, the People section gives you the tools to keep your records organized and up to date.

## What You Can Do

Here is an overview of the key features available in the People section:

1. **Search your directory** -- Use the quick search bar to find anyone by name, or take advantage of advanced filters and AI-powered natural language search to locate exactly who you need. See [Searching People](./searching-people) and [AI Search](./ai-search) for details.

2. **Add new people** -- Quickly add individuals to your directory and fill in their profile details, contact information, and household connections. See [Adding People](./adding-people) for step-by-step instructions.

3. **Import and export data** -- Bring in member data from a CSV file or migrate from another church management system like Breeze. You can also export your directory to CSV at any time. See [Importing Data](./importing-data) and [Exporting Data](./exporting-data).

4. **Manage profiles** -- View and edit detailed profiles for each person, including contact info, household members, group memberships, attendance history, donations, and custom forms.

5. **Assign roles and permissions** -- Control who on your team can access different parts of B1 Admin by assigning roles. See [Assigning Roles](./roles-permissions).

## Getting Started

To access the People section, click **People** in the left sidebar of your B1 Admin dashboard. You will see your full church directory with a search bar at the top and a list of members below.
