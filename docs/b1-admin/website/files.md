# Files

The Files page is the central repository for all media and documents used on your church website. From here you can upload, organize, browse, and manage every image, document, and media file your site needs.

## Uploading Files

1. Navigate to the **Website** section in B1 Admin and click the **Files** tab.
2. Drag and drop files directly onto the upload area, or click the upload button to browse your computer.
3. Your files will upload and appear in the file library immediately.

:::tip
For best results, optimize images before uploading. Smaller file sizes help your website load faster for visitors.

## Organizing with Folders

1. Create folders to group related files together -- for example, "Sermon Graphics," "Event Banners," or "Staff Photos."
2. Move files between folders to keep your library tidy as it grows.
3. Use clear, descriptive folder names so your team can find files quickly.

## Browsing and Searching

- Scroll through the file library to see thumbnails of all your uploaded files.
- Use the **search** function to find files by name when your library gets large.
- Click on any file to view its details, including the file name, size, and URL.

## Using Files on Your Website

1. Click on a file to view its details.
2. **Copy the file URL** to use it in your website pages. You can paste this URL into image elements, download links, or anywhere else that accepts a file URL.
3. Files you upload here are available for use across all your website pages and content blocks.

## Deleting Files

1. Select the file you want to remove.
2. Click the **Delete** button to permanently remove it from your library.
3. Make sure the file is not currently being used on any page before deleting it, as this will break any links or images that reference it.

:::note
Deleted files cannot be recovered. Double-check that a file is no longer in use before removing it.
