# Website

The Website section in B1 Admin gives you a full-featured website builder for your church. You can create pages, customize your site's look and feel, manage media files, and publish event calendars -- all without writing any code.

## What You Can Do

The Website builder is organized into five main areas:

### Pages

Create and manage all the pages on your church website. The **Pages** table shows each page along with its status -- either **Generated** (automatically created by the system) or **Custom** (created by you). You can add new custom pages, edit existing ones, or convert auto-generated pages into custom pages for full control over their content.

The left sidebar displays your navigation links in a tree structure. You can reorder links using drag-and-drop to set the exact hierarchy and order you want visitors to see.

### Blocks

Build reusable content components that you can place on multiple pages. Blocks save you time when you have content like a call-to-action, announcement banner, or contact section that appears in more than one place. Update a block once and the change applies everywhere it is used.

### Appearance

Customize your website's theme, colors, fonts, logo, and spacing. You can apply pre-built style themes for a quick start or fine-tune every detail with the color palette editor, typography settings, and custom CSS.

### Files

Upload and organize all your media assets -- images, documents, and other files -- in one central location. Use folders to keep things tidy and copy file URLs for use anywhere on your site.

### Calendars

Publish event calendars on your website so visitors can see what is happening at your church. Create curated calendars that pull events from multiple groups into a single view.
