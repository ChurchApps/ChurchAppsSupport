# Managing Pages

<div class="article-intro">

The Website Pages view is your central hub for creating, editing, and organizing all the pages on your church website. You can manage both your page content and your site's navigation from this single screen.

</div>

<div class="prereqs">
<h4>Before You Begin</h4>

- Complete the [Initial Setup](initial-setup) to configure your domain and basic site settings
- Have your content and images ready. Use the [Files](files) manager to upload media assets first.

</div>

## Understanding Page Types

The **Pages** table lists every page on your site along with its status:

- **Generated** -- Pages that were automatically created by the system based on your church's data (for example, a Groups page or Sermons page). These pages update themselves as your data changes.
- **Custom** -- Pages that you created yourself with your own content and layout.

You can convert any auto-generated page into a custom page if you want full control over its content and design.

## Adding and Editing Pages

1. Click the **Add Page** button in the top right corner of the Pages table.
2. Choose a page type (blank or a template) and give it a name.
3. Click **Edit** next to any page to open the page builder, where you can add sections, text, images, and other elements.
4. Click **Page Settings** to update the page title, URL path, and other metadata.
5. Use the **Preview** button to open your page in a new window and see exactly how it will look to visitors.

:::tip
For your home page, set the URL path to just `/`. For all other pages, use a descriptive path like `/about` or `/contact`.

## Managing Navigation

The left sidebar of the Website Pages view displays your navigation links. These links control the menu that visitors see on your website.

1. Click **Add** to create a new navigation link. You can point it to any page on your site or to an external URL.
2. To reorder links, drag and drop them into the order you want. You can also nest links under a parent item to create dropdown menus.
3. Click the **Edit** icon next to any link to change its label, URL, or position.
4. To remove a link from the navigation, click the **Delete** icon.

:::info
Removing a navigation link does not delete the page itself. The page still exists and can be accessed directly by its URL -- it simply will not appear in the menu.

## Tips for Organizing Your Site

- Keep your top-level navigation to five or six items so visitors can find things quickly.
- Use nested links for related sub-pages (for example, an "About" dropdown with "Our Team," "Beliefs," and "History").
- Review your navigation on mobile by clicking **Mobile Preview** to make sure it works well on smaller screens.
- Give pages clear, descriptive names that help visitors understand what they will find.

:::tip
You can add [forms](../forms/creating-forms.md) to your pages to collect registrations, prayer requests, or other information from visitors.
