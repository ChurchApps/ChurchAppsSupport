3. Set fonts for both headings and body text.
4. Click **Typography Scale** to adjust the size hierarchy for Heading 1 through Heading 4. Use the scale multiplier and base size fields to fine-tune.

## Logo and Branding

2. Upload your **Light Background Logo** and **Dark Background Logo**. Use images with a transparent background and a 4:1 aspect ratio for best results.
3. Upload a **Social Media Image** for link previews and a **Favicon** for the browser tab icon.

:::tip
For best results, use a logo with a transparent background in PNG format. This ensures it looks great on both light and dark backgrounds across your website and [mobile app](../settings/mobile-app.md).

## Custom CSS and JavaScript

1. Click **CSS and Javascript** in the Style Settings panel.
2. Add **Custom CSS** to override default styles for advanced customization.
3. Add **Custom HTML** for tracking codes or other scripts.
4. Use the **Common Javascript Examples** section for snippets like Google Analytics integration.

:::warning
Custom CSS is powerful but can break your site's layout if used incorrectly. Most churches can achieve the look they want using the built-in color, font, and spacing controls. Only use custom CSS if you are comfortable with web development.

## Style Themes

If you want a quick starting point, the **Suggested Palettes** in the Color Palette section offer pre-built themes that set coordinated colors in one click. You can always fine-tune individual settings after applying a theme.
