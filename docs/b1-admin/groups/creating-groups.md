# Creating Groups

<div class="article-intro">

Creating a group in B1 Admin is straightforward. You will set up a category, name your group, and then configure its settings. Groups help you organize your church into meaningful units like small groups, ministry teams, committees, and classes.

</div>

<div class="prereqs">
<h4>Before You Begin</h4>

- You need an active B1 Admin account with permission to manage groups. See [Roles & Permissions](../people/roles-permissions.md) if you're unsure about your access level.
- Decide on a category structure for your groups (for example, "Small Groups," "Ministries," "Committees"). Categories help keep related groups organized.

</div>

## Adding a New Group

1. Navigate to the **B1 Admin dashboard**.
2. Click on the **Groups** tab.
3. Click **Add Group** and enter a **Category Name**. Categories help you organize related groups together (for example, "Small Groups," "Ministries," or "Committees"). If a category already exists, you can select it from the list.
4. Enter the **Group Name**.
5. Click **Add**. Your new group will appear in the list under the chosen category.

## Configuring Group Settings

Once your group is created, you can fill in additional details:

1. Click on the **group name** in the list to open it.
2. Click the **pencil icon** to edit the group settings.
3. Configure the following options:
   - **Description** -- A brief summary of what the group is about. This is visible to members.
   - **Meeting Times** -- When the group typically meets (for example, "Wednesdays at 7 PM").
   - **Attendance Tracking** -- Enable this if you want to record [attendance](../attendance/tracking-attendance.md) for this group.
   - **Service Times** -- Associate the group with specific church service times if applicable. See [Attendance Setup](../attendance/setup.md) for details on service times.
4. Click **Save** to apply your changes.
