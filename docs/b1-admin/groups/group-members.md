# Group Members

Once you have created a group, the next step is adding members. From a group's detail page you can search for people, add them to the group, assign leaders, send messages, and export the member list.

## Adding Members to a Group

1. Navigate to the **Groups** page and click on the group you want to manage.
2. Click the **Members** tab.
3. In the search box, type the name of the person you want to add.
4. Click **Add** next to the person's name in the search results.
5. The person now appears in the group member list.

:::tip
Leave the search box blank and click **Search** to browse through your entire directory. This is helpful if you are not sure of the exact spelling of someone's name.

## Designating Group Leaders

Group leaders have special privileges -- they can edit the group calendar, manage events, and help coordinate the group.

1. In the group member list, find the person you want to make a leader.
2. Click the **green key icon** next to their name.
3. The person is now designated as a group leader.

To remove leader status, click the green key icon again.

:::info
Any group member can view the group calendar and events, but only leaders can add or edit calendar events.

## Sending Messages to Group Members

You can communicate with all members of a group directly from B1 Admin:

1. From the group detail page, look for the messaging area.
2. Type your message in the text box.
3. Click **Send**.

Your message will be delivered to all members of the group.

## Exporting Group Data

To download the group member list as a file:

1. From the group detail page, click the **download icon**.
2. A CSV file containing the group's member information will download to your computer.

This is useful for creating printed rosters, importing data into other tools, or keeping offline records.

## Removing Members

To remove someone from a group, locate their name in the member list and click the **remove** button next to their entry. The person will be removed from the group but will remain in your church directory.
