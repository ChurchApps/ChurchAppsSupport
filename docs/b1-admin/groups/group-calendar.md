# Group Calendar

Each group in B1 can have its own event calendar. Group leaders use it to schedule meetings, activities, and recurring events. All group members can view upcoming events and join conversations about them.

## Accessing the Group Calendar

The group calendar is available through the B1.church member-facing app:

1. From B1 Admin, click the **dropdown menu** in the top right corner of your screen.
2. Select **Switch App**.
3. Choose **B1.church**.
4. Click **Groups** in the left sidebar.
5. Select your group from the list.
6. Click **Calendar** on the left side of the screen.

:::info
The group calendar is managed through B1.church (the member app) rather than B1 Admin. Group leaders access it by switching apps from the admin dashboard.

## Adding an Event

1. From the group calendar, click **Add an Event**.
2. Enter a **title** for the event.
3. Write a short **description** of what the event is about.
4. Set the **start time** and **end time**.
5. Click **Save** to add the event to the calendar.

## Setting Up Recurring Events

If your group meets on a regular schedule, you can set events to repeat automatically:

1. When creating or editing an event, check the **Recurring** box.
2. Choose how the event should repeat:
   - **Interval** -- Set a number of days between occurrences. For example, entering "7" repeats the event every 7 days.
   - **Frequency** -- Choose to repeat by **day**, **week**, or **month**.
3. Save the event. It will now appear on the calendar at each scheduled occurrence.

:::tip
For a group that meets every Saturday, set the frequency to "week" and choose Saturday. The event will automatically populate on the calendar going forward.

## Viewing the Calendar

The group calendar offers multiple view options:

- **Month** -- See the full month at a glance.
- **Week** -- Focus on the current week.
- **Day** -- View a single day in detail.
- **Agenda** -- See a list of upcoming events in chronological order.

Switch between views using the buttons at the top of the calendar.

## Event Details and Conversations

Click on any event to view its details. From the event detail view:

- **Members and leaders** can start conversations and leave comments about the event.
- **Leaders** can edit event details, change times, or delete the event.

## Subscribing to the Calendar

You can sync the group calendar with your personal calendar:

1. From the group calendar page, click **Subscribe**.
2. Follow the prompts to add the calendar to Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Outlook, or any other calendar application that supports subscriptions.

This keeps your personal schedule in sync with your group's events without needing to check B1 separately.
