# Groups

<div class="article-intro">

The **Groups** section lets you organize your church members into teams, ministries, small groups, Bible studies, committees, and more. Groups are the backbone of community life at your church, and this section gives you the tools to create, manage, and communicate with every group in one place.

</div>

## Overview

Groups are organized by **category**. A category is a top-level label such as "Small Groups," "Ministries," or "Committees." Each category can contain multiple groups, making it simple to keep related groups together.

When you open the Groups page, you will see a summary at the top showing:

- **Total Groups** -- the number of groups across all categories
- **Categories** -- the number of group categories you have created
- **Total Members** -- the combined count of members across all groups

Below the summary, your groups are listed by category with the member count shown for each group.

## What You Can Do

Here is what you can accomplish in the Groups section:

1. **Create and organize groups** -- Add new groups within categories to reflect how your church is structured. See [Creating Groups](./creating-groups.md).

2. **Manage group members** -- Add and remove members, designate leaders, and communicate with your groups. See [Group Members](./group-members.md).

3. **Schedule events** -- Each group can have its own calendar for meetings, events, and recurring activities. See [Group Calendar](./group-calendar.md).

4. **Export group data** -- Download member lists for any group as a CSV file for use in spreadsheets or mailings. See [Group Members](./group-members.md) for export instructions.

## Getting Started

To access Groups, click **People** in the left sidebar of your B1 Admin dashboard, then select **Groups**. You will see all of your existing groups organized by category.

:::tip
If you are just getting started, begin by creating a few categories that match your church structure (for example, "Ministries," "Small Groups," "Teams"). Then add individual groups within each category. See [Creating Groups](./creating-groups.md) for a step-by-step walkthrough.
:::

:::info
Group members must first exist in your [People](../people/adding-people.md) directory before they can be added to a group. If you are setting up B1 for the first time, [import your member data](../people/importing-data.md) before creating groups.
