# Settings

The **Settings** section is where you configure your church's account, branding, and administrative options in B1 Admin. From here you can manage everything from your church name to user permissions.

## What You Will Find Here

The Settings area is organized into four sub-sections accessible from the sidebar:

1. **Settings** -- Configure your church's basic information, branding, and subdomain.
2. **Mobile Apps** -- Set up and customize the navigation tabs that appear in the B1 Mobile app for your members.
3. **Server Admin** -- Access advanced administration tools for managing your church's server-level settings.
4. **Forms** -- Create and manage custom forms for collecting information from your congregation.

## The Main Settings Page

When you first open the Settings page, you will see your **church name** and **subdomain** displayed at the top. The header provides quick-access buttons for common tasks:

- **Edit Settings** -- Update your church's name, address, contact information, and branding.
- **Mobile Apps** -- Jump directly to mobile app configuration.
- **Roles** -- Manage user roles and permissions for your team.
- **Import/Export** -- Transfer data between systems using the import/export tool.

:::tip
Start by configuring your church name and branding under **Edit Settings**, then set up **Roles** to invite your team members with the right level of access.
