# Mobile App Settings

The Mobile App Settings page lets you configure the navigation tabs that appear in the B1 Mobile app for your church members. You control which tabs are visible, what they link to, and how they are displayed.

## Accessing Mobile App Settings

1. Navigate to the **Settings** page in the left sidebar.
2. Click the **Mobile Apps** button in the header.
3. The Mobile App Settings page displays your current app tabs.

## Adding a New Tab

1. Click the **Add Tab** button at the top of the page.
2. Fill in the tab details:
   - **Name** -- The label that appears on the tab (for example, "Sermons" or "Give").
   - **Icon** -- Click the icon selector to choose an icon for your tab. You can also upload a custom image.
   - **Tab Type** -- Select from options like Bible, Live Stream, Donation, Website, and more.
   - **URL** -- Enter the web address the tab should link to.
   - **Visibility** -- Control who can see this tab (everyone, members only, etc.).
3. Click **Save Tab** to add it to your app.

## Editing an Existing Tab

1. Click on any existing tab in the **App Tabs** list.
2. Update the tab's name, icon, URL, type, or visibility settings.
3. Click **Save Tab** to apply your changes.

## Reordering Tabs

You can change the order in which tabs appear in the mobile app. Drag and drop tabs in the list to rearrange them. The order shown on this page matches the order your members will see in the app.

:::info
Some tabs may appear automatically when certain conditions are met -- for example, a Live Stream tab may show up when a stream is active. Manually added tabs give you full control over what your members see at all times.
:::

:::tip
Keep your tab count manageable. Three to five tabs works well for most churches. Too many tabs can make navigation confusing for your members.

## Where These Tabs Appear

The tabs you configure here are displayed in the **B1 Mobile app** (B1.church app) that your church members download from the App Store or Google Play. Changes you make on this page are reflected in the app the next time a member opens it.
