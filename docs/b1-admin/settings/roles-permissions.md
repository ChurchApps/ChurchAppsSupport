# Roles & Permissions

<div class="article-intro">

Roles let you control what different users can access within your ChurchApps account. You can create custom roles for staff, volunteers, and other team members, each with their own level of access to keep your data secure.

</div>

<div class="prereqs">
<h4>Before You Begin</h4>

- You need Domain Admin access or a role with permission to manage roles
- Have a list of team members and the areas they need access to
- Review the available permission categories below to plan your roles

</div>

## Accessing Roles

1. Navigate to the **Settings** page in the left sidebar.
2. Click the **Roles** button in the header.
3. The Roles page displays all currently defined roles for your church.

## Understanding the Roles Page

The Roles page is divided into two panels:

- **Left side** -- Shows the list of members assigned to the selected role.
- **Right side** -- Displays the permission settings you can configure for that role.

Click on any role name to view and manage its members and permissions.

## Adding Users to a Role

1. Select the role you want to add members to.
2. Use the **search field** on the left side to find the person you want to add.
3. Select the person from the search results.
4. They will be added to the role immediately.

## Removing Users from a Role

1. Select the role containing the user you want to remove.
2. Find the person in the member list on the left side.
3. Click the **remove button** next to their name.

## Configuring Permissions

Each role can be granted access to specific areas of B1 Admin. Permissions are organized by section:

- **People** -- Access to the member directory and person records.
- **Donations** -- Access to donation records and fund management.
- **Attendance** -- Access to attendance tracking and reports.
- **Content** -- Access to website and content management.
- And additional areas as they are available.

Use the checkboxes on the right side of the Roles page to enable or disable access for each area.

:::warning
**Domain Admins** have full access to all areas of your ChurchApps account. Their permissions cannot be modified or restricted. Use this role only for your most trusted administrators.

:::tip
Create specific roles like "Treasurer" with only **Donations** access, or "Check-In Volunteer" with only **Attendance** access. This follows the principle of least privilege and keeps your data secure. See [Data Security](./data-security.md) for more on how ChurchApps protects your information.
