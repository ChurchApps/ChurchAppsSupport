# Sermons

<div class="article-intro">

The Sermons section in B1 Admin lets you manage your church's sermon library and live streaming. You can add individual sermons, organize them into playlists, configure live stream schedules, and import existing content in bulk from YouTube or Vimeo.

</div>

:::info
To access the Sermons section, you need the **contentApi.streamingServices.edit** permission. If you do not see Sermons in your menu, ask your church administrator to grant you the appropriate role. See [Roles & Permissions](../settings/roles-permissions.md) for details on managing permissions.

## What You Can Do

The Sermons section is organized into four main areas:

### Sermons

Add and manage individual sermon entries in your library. Each sermon can include a title, speaker, date, description, thumbnail, and links to video or audio content. You can link sermons to YouTube, Vimeo, Facebook, or custom video URLs. See [Managing Sermons](managing-sermons) for full details.

### Playlists

Organize your sermons into series or collections. Playlists make it easy for your congregation to browse through a sermon series in order. Each playlist has its own name, description, and thumbnail. See [Playlists](playlists) for more information.

### Live Stream Times

Configure your church's live streaming schedule. Set up recurring weekly services or one-time events, manage chat and video settings, and control when your stream goes live. Visitors will see the next scheduled service time on your streaming page. See [Live Streaming](live-streaming) for setup instructions.

### Bulk Import

Quickly populate your sermon library by importing videos in bulk from YouTube or Vimeo. This is the fastest way to migrate your existing sermon content into B1. See [Bulk Import](bulk-import) to get started.

:::tip
If you are setting up sermons for the first time, start by creating a [playlist](playlists), then either [add sermons individually](managing-sermons) or [import them in bulk](bulk-import) from YouTube or Vimeo.
