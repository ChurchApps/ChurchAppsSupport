# Managing Sermons

The Sermons page displays your entire sermon library. From here you can add new sermons, edit existing entries, and organize your content by playlist.

## Viewing Your Sermon Library

1. In the B1 Admin, click **Sermons** in the left sidebar.
2. The Sermons page shows all your sermon entries, organized by playlist. Each sermon displays its thumbnail, title, and date.
3. Click on any sermon to view or edit its details.

## Adding a Sermon

1. Click the **Add Sermon** button in the top right corner and select **Add Sermon** from the dropdown.
2. Select a **Playlist** to assign the sermon to.
3. Choose your **Video Provider** -- YouTube, Vimeo, Facebook, or Custom URL. We recommend YouTube as it works best with the B1 system.
4. Enter the video ID or URL and click **Fetch**. For YouTube, the video ID is the string of characters after `v=` in the YouTube URL.
5. When you click **Fetch**, the sermon details are imported automatically, including the publish date, duration, title, description, and thumbnail.
6. Make any changes you want and click **Save**.

You can also add a permanent live stream URL by selecting **Add Permanent Live URL** from the Add Sermon dropdown. This creates a persistent connection to your YouTube channel's live stream using your Channel ID.

## Scheduling a Sermon for Live Stream

After adding a sermon, you can schedule it for broadcast on your live stream page:

1. Go to the **Live Stream Times** tab.
