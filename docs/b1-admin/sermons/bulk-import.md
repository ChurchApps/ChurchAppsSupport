# Bulk Import

<div class="article-intro">

The Bulk Import page lets you quickly populate your sermon library by importing videos from YouTube or Vimeo. This is the fastest way to bring in your existing sermon content rather than adding each video one at a time.

</div>

<div class="prereqs">
<h4>Before You Begin</h4>

- You need the **contentApi.streamingServices.edit** permission. See [Roles & Permissions](../settings/roles-permissions.md) if you do not have access.
- Create at least one [playlist](playlists) to import your sermons into
- Have your YouTube Channel ID or Vimeo account information ready

</div>

## Choosing Your Source

1. In the B1 Admin, click **Sermons** in the left sidebar, then click the **Bulk Import** tab.
2. You will see two clickable cards:
   - **YouTube** (red) -- Import videos from a YouTube channel
   - **Vimeo** (blue) -- Import videos from a Vimeo account
3. Click the card for the platform where your sermons are hosted.

:::tip
You can go back and switch sources at any time if you have videos on both platforms.

## Before You Import

Before importing videos, you need at least one playlist to organize them into. If you have not created any playlists yet:

1. Click the **Playlists** tab.
2. Click **Create First Playlist** and fill in the name, description, publish date, and thumbnail.
3. Click **Save**, then return to the **Bulk Import** tab.

See [Playlists](playlists) for detailed instructions on creating and managing playlists.

## Importing Videos

1. After selecting YouTube or Vimeo, enter your **YouTube Channel ID** or **Vimeo account information** in the field provided.
2. Click the **Fetch** button to retrieve all available videos from your channel or account.
3. After fetching, you will see a list of all your videos with checkboxes.
4. Check the boxes next to the videos you want to import. You can select all or pick specific ones.
5. Optionally, enable **Auto Import New Videos** to automatically add future uploads to your library.
6. Click the **Import Into Playlist** dropdown to choose which playlist these videos should be added to.
7. Click the **Import** button to complete the bulk import.

Your videos will be imported with all their details, including titles, descriptions, dates, and thumbnails.

:::info
Bulk import is ideal for getting started when you are migrating from another platform. For adding individual sermons going forward, use the [Managing Sermons](managing-sermons) page instead.
