# Playlists

Playlists let you organize your sermons into series or collections. When visitors browse your sermon library on your B1.church website, playlists help them find and follow along with a complete sermon series in the right order.

## Viewing Playlists

1. In the B1 Admin, click **Sermons** in the left sidebar.
2. Click the **Playlists** tab at the top of the page.
3. You will see a list of all your existing playlists with their names and descriptions.

## Creating a Playlist

1. Click the **Create First Playlist** button (if you have no playlists yet) or click **Add Playlist**.
2. Enter a **name** for the playlist -- for example, the sermon series title like "Faith Foundations" or "Summer in the Psalms."
3. Add a **description** to give visitors a brief overview of the series.
4. Set a **publish date** to control when the playlist becomes visible.
5. Upload a **thumbnail image** to represent the series visually.
6. Click **Save** to create your playlist.

## Adding Sermons to a Playlist

When you add or edit a sermon, you assign it to a playlist using the **Playlist** dropdown. All sermons assigned to the same playlist are grouped together and displayed in order on your website.

:::tip
Create your playlists first before adding sermons. This way you can assign each sermon to the correct playlist as you go, rather than reorganizing later.

Playlists are displayed on your B1.church website as browsable collections. Visitors can:
