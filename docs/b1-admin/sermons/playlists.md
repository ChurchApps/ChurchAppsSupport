# Playlists

<div class="article-intro">

Playlists let you organize your sermons into series or collections. When visitors browse your sermon library on your B1.church website, playlists help them find and follow along with a complete sermon series in the right order.

<h4>Before You Begin</h4>

- You need the **contentApi.streamingServices.edit** permission. See [Roles & Permissions](../settings/roles-permissions.md) if you do not have access.
- Have a name, description, and thumbnail image ready for your playlist

</div>

## Viewing Playlists

1. In the B1 Admin, click **Sermons** in the left sidebar.
2. Click the **Playlists** tab at the top of the page.
3. You will see a list of all your existing playlists with their names and descriptions.

## Creating a Playlist

1. Click the **Create First Playlist** button (if you have no playlists yet) or click **Add Playlist**.
2. Enter a **name** for the playlist -- for example, the sermon series title like "Faith Foundations" or "Summer in the Psalms."
3. Add a **description** to give visitors a brief overview of the series.
4. Set a **publish date** to control when the playlist becomes visible.
5. Upload a **thumbnail image** to represent the series visually.
6. Click **Save** to create your playlist.

:::tip
Create your playlists first before adding sermons. This way you can assign each sermon to the correct playlist as you go, rather than reorganizing later.

## Adding Sermons to a Playlist

When you [add or edit a sermon](managing-sermons), you assign it to a playlist using the **Playlist** dropdown. All sermons assigned to the same playlist are grouped together and displayed in order on your website.

:::info
You can also assign sermons to playlists during [Bulk Import](bulk-import). When importing from YouTube or Vimeo, select a playlist from the **Import Into Playlist** dropdown before clicking **Import**.

## How Playlists Appear on Your Website

Playlists are displayed on your B1.church website as browsable collections. Visitors can:

- See all available sermon series at a glance
- Click into a playlist to view all sermons in that series
- Watch or listen to sermons in order

## Next Steps

- [Managing Sermons](managing-sermons) -- Add individual sermons to your playlists
- [Bulk Import](bulk-import) -- Import multiple sermons and assign them to playlists
