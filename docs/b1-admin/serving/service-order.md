# Service Order

<div class="article-intro">

The service order defines the sequence of elements in your worship service. Use it to lay out everything from the opening song to the closing prayer, so your entire team knows the flow of the service ahead of time.

</div>

<div class="prereqs">
<h4>Before You Begin</h4>

- [Create a service plan](./plans.md) for the date you want to build a service order for
- Optionally, add [songs](./songs.md) to your library so you can link them directly into the service order

</div>

## Accessing the Service Order

1. Navigate to **Serving** and select your ministry.
2. Click on a **plan type**, then open a specific **plan**.
3. Click the **Service Order** tab on the plan detail page.

## Building Your Service Order

The service order is a list of items arranged in the sequence they will occur during the service. Common elements include:

- Worship songs
- Prayers
- Scripture readings
- Announcements
- Sermon or message
- Offering
- Closing

## Adding Items to the Service Order

1. On the **Service Order** tab, click **Add Item**.

3. Enter the details for the item, such as the title and any notes.
4. Click **Save**.

:::tip
You can add songs directly from your [Songs](./songs.md) library. This links the song details, including lyrics and arrangements, to your service plan so your worship team has everything they need.
