# Serving

The Serving section is your hub for coordinating volunteers and planning church services. Whether you are organizing Sunday worship, midweek gatherings, or special events, this is where you bring everything together.

## How the Serving Page Works

When you open the **Serving** page, you will see your ministries displayed as tabs across the top. Each ministry has its own plan types and teams, so you can manage multiple ministries independently. For example, you might have separate tabs for Worship, Kids Ministry, and Hospitality.

If you are an admin, toggle **Show All** to view all ministries at once. This is helpful when you need to check assignments across multiple teams.

## Sub-Sections

The Serving section includes three key areas:

- **[Plans](./plans)** -- Create service plans for specific dates and assign volunteers to teams. Plans help you organize who is serving when, so everyone knows their role ahead of time.
- **[Songs](./songs)** -- Manage your worship song library with lyrics, arrangements, and external links. Your worship team can use this to prepare for upcoming services.
- **[Tasks](./tasks)** -- Assign and track tasks for your team members. Set up [Automations](./automations) to create recurring tasks automatically, so nothing falls through the cracks.

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to **Serving** from the main menu in B1 Admin.
2. Select a **ministry tab** to view its plan types and teams.
3. Choose a plan type to start creating service plans, or explore the Songs and Tasks sub-sections.

Before you can create plans, you will need to set up your ministries and teams in the Settings area. See the Settings documentation for details on configuring your serving structure.
