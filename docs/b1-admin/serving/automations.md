# Automations

<div class="article-intro">

Automations create tasks automatically on a recurring schedule. Instead of manually creating the same tasks every week or month, you can set up an automation once and let the system handle it for you, ensuring nothing falls through the cracks.

<h4>Before You Begin</h4>

- Familiarize yourself with how [Tasks](./tasks.md) work in B1 Admin
- Identify which recurring responsibilities you want to automate

</div>

## Viewing Automations

Navigate to **Serving** and open the **Automations** page. You will see a list of all your automations, each showing its title, active status, and recurrence pattern.

## Creating an Automation

1. On the Automations page, click **Add Automation**.
2. Enter a **title** for the automation. This will also be used as the title of the tasks it creates.
3. Set the **recurrence pattern** -- choose how often the task should be created (for example, weekly, monthly, or on specific days).
4. Assign the task to a **person or group** who will be responsible each time it runs.
5. Set the automation to **Active** so it begins creating tasks on schedule.
6. Click **Save**.

## Editing an Automation

1. Click on an existing automation in the list to open it.
2. Update the title, recurrence pattern, assignment, or any other settings.
3. Click **Save** to apply your changes.

## Activating and Deactivating

You can control whether an automation is running without deleting it:

- **Active** -- The automation will create tasks according to its schedule.
- **Inactive** -- The automation is paused and will not create any new tasks until you reactivate it.

:::tip
Set an automation to **Inactive** during holiday breaks or special seasons when the recurring task is not needed. You can reactivate it at any time without losing your configuration.

## How It Works

When an automation runs, it creates a new [task](./tasks.md) with the configured title and assignment. The task behaves just like any other task -- assignees receive notifications and can manage the task from their dashboard or the Tasks page.

:::info
Automations only create new tasks going forward. They do not retroactively create tasks for past dates.
