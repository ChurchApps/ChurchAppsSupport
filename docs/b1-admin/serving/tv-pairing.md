# Pairing a TV or Display to a Plan Type

<div class="article-intro">

You can pair a TV, Fire Stick, or Android device to a plan type in B1 Admin so it automatically displays the scheduled lesson content for that ministry. Once paired, the TV always shows the right content for the right room — no manual setup needed each week.

<div class="prereqs">
<h4>Before You Begin</h4>

- Set up at least one plan type in your ministry
- Install the Lessons.church Screen app on the TV or device you want to pair (see download links below)

</div>

## Download the TV App

Install the **Lessons.church Screen** app on your classroom display:

- **Fire Stick / Amazon devices** — Search for "Lessons.church" in the Amazon App Store
- **Android TV / Google TV** — Search for "Lessons.church Screen" in the Google Play Store

## Pairing the Device

1. Open the Lessons.church Screen app on the TV — it will display a **4-character pairing code** on screen
2. In B1 Admin, go to **Serving** and open your ministry
3. Find the plan type you want to pair the TV to
4. Click the **Pair TV App** button next to the plan type
5. Enter the 4-character code shown on the TV screen
6. Click **Pair**
7. The TV displays a success message and is now linked to that plan type

Once paired, the TV will automatically show the lesson content scheduled for that plan type each week — no need to set it up again.

:::tip
Pair each classroom's TV to its matching plan type (e.g., pair the Preschool TV to the "Preschool" plan type). When you schedule a new lesson for that plan type, the TV picks it up automatically.

:::info
The pairing code is only valid for a few minutes. If it expires before you finish, simply restart the TV app to get a new code.
