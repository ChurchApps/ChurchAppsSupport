# Connecting a Classroom TV to Your B1 Admin Lessons

<div class="article-intro">

You can connect a classroom TV to your B1 Admin lessons using **FreePlay** — ChurchApps' free TV app for churches. Once connected, the TV displays the lesson content you have scheduled in B1 Admin, making it available for your teachers right on the classroom screen.

<div class="prereqs">
<h4>Before You Begin</h4>

- Schedule at least one lesson in B1 Admin (see [Scheduling Lessons](./scheduling-lessons.md))
- Install **FreePlay** on the TV or Fire Stick you want to use

</div>

## Step 1 — Install FreePlay on Your TV

Install the **FreePlay** app on your classroom display:

- **Amazon Fire Stick / Fire TV** — Search for **FreePlay** in the Amazon Appstore
- **Android TV / Google TV** — Search for **FreePlay** in the Google Play Store
- **Apple TV** — Search for **FreePlay** in the App Store

For full setup instructions see the [FreePlay Getting Started guide](/docs/freeplay/getting-started/).

## Step 2 — Connect B1.church as a Content Provider

1. Open the **FreePlay** app on the TV
2. Navigate to the **Content Providers** screen (select the **Providers** icon in the sidebar)
3. Find and select **B1.church** from the list of available providers
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to sign in with your B1 church credentials
5. FreePlay displays **Connected!** once the connection is successful

Once connected, B1.church appears in your FreePlay sidebar. FreePlay will pull the lesson content you have scheduled in B1 Admin so your teachers can play it directly on the classroom TV.

:::tip
After connecting, your teachers can use the TV remote to advance through videos and slides at their own pace as the lesson flows. No separate setup or USB drives needed.
