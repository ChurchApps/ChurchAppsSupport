- **Add lyrics** -- Enter or update the lyrics for each arrangement.
- **Set the key** -- Specify the musical key for each arrangement so your team knows how to prepare.
- **Add external links** -- Attach links to resources like YouTube videos, chord charts, or sheet music hosted elsewhere.

## Arrangements

A single song can have multiple arrangements to accommodate different services or team configurations. Each arrangement includes:

- **Lyrics** for display or projection
- **Key** designation
- **External links** to additional resources
