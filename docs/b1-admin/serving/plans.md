# Service Plans

Service plans organize who is serving and when. Each plan is tied to a specific date and ministry, making it easy to coordinate your volunteer teams week by week.

## Accessing Plans

1. Navigate to **Serving** from the main menu.
2. Select a **ministry tab** at the top of the page.
3. Click on a **plan type** to see the list of plans for that type.
4. Click on a specific plan to open it.

## Creating a Plan

1. From the plan type view, click **Add Plan**.
2. Select the **date** for the service.
3. Save the plan. You can now begin assigning team members and building out the service order.

## The Plan Detail Page

When you open a plan, you will see two tabs:

- **Assignments** -- Manage which team members are assigned to this plan. You can add people from your existing teams and see who has confirmed or is still pending.
- **[Service Order](./service-order)** -- Build the order of service with elements like worship songs, prayers, announcements, and the sermon.

## Assigning Team Members

1. Open a plan and go to the **Assignments** tab.
2. Click on a **team** to expand it.
3. Add members from your team roster by clicking **Add**.
4. Assigned members will appear under their team with their assignment status.

## Printing Plans

You can print a plan for distribution to your team. Open the plan and use the **Print** option to generate a printable version that includes assignments and the service order. This is useful for handing out at rehearsals or posting in a common area.
