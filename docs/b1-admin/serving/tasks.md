# Tasks

<div class="article-intro">

Tasks let you assign action items to people or groups in your church. Whether it is a one-time to-do or a recurring responsibility, tasks help you track what needs to be done and who is responsible so nothing gets overlooked.

<h4>Before You Begin</h4>

- Make sure the people or [groups](../groups/creating-groups.md) you want to assign tasks to exist in B1 Admin
- Navigate to the **Serving** section to access the Tasks page

</div>

## Viewing Tasks

Navigate to **Serving** and open the **Tasks** page. You will see a list of your open tasks. Each task shows its title, assignee, and status.

:::tip
By default, only open tasks are shown. Toggle **Show Closed** to see completed tasks as well.
:::

## Creating a Task

1. On the Tasks page, click **Add Task**.
2. Enter a **title** for the task.
3. Click the **Assign To** box and type the name of a person, or switch to **Group** and type a group name.
4. Click **Search** and select the person or group from the results.
5. Add a **note** with any details or instructions for the assignee.
6. Click **Save**.

The task will now appear in the task list and will be visible to the assignee on their dashboard and mobile app.

## Managing a Task

Click on any task to open its detail page. From here you can:

- **Change the status** -- Switch between **Open** and **Closed** using the status dropdown.
- **Reassign the task** -- Update the assignee to a different person or group.
- **Add notes** -- Include additional information or updates for the assignee.
- **Edit the title** -- Update the task title as needed.

## Task Lifecycle

1. A new task starts with a status of **Open**.
2. The assignee receives a notification and can view the task from their dashboard, the Tasks page, or the mobile app.
3. Once the work is complete, the assignee (or an admin) changes the status to **Closed**.
4. Closed tasks are removed from the default view but can still be accessed by enabling **Show Closed**.

:::info
You can automate recurring tasks so they are created on a schedule. See [Automations](./automations.md) for details on setting this up.

## Next Steps

- Set up [Automations](./automations.md) to create recurring tasks automatically
- Use tasks alongside [Service Plans](./plans.md) to track service preparation action items
