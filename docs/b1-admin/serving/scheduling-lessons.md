# Scheduling Lessons from Lessons.church

<div class="article-intro">

B1 Admin integrates directly with [Lessons.church](https://lessons.church) so you can schedule curriculum for your classrooms right inside your service plans. This keeps everything — volunteers, assignments, and lesson content — in one place.

</div>

<div class="prereqs">
<h4>Before You Begin</h4>

- Set up your ministries in the Serving area
- Have an active [Lessons.church](https://lessons.church) account — sign up there first if your church doesn't have one yet

</div>

## Step 1 — Link Your Lessons.church Account

This is a one-time setup per ministry. You need to connect your Lessons.church account before you can browse and schedule content.

1. Log in to [B1 Admin](https://admin.b1.church/) and go to **Serving**
2. Open the ministry you want to connect (e.g., Children's Ministry)
3. Scroll down to the **Content Provider Accounts** section
4. Click **Link New Provider**
5. Select **Lessons.church** from the list
6. A device authorization screen will appear with a code
7. Go to [lessons.church](https://lessons.church), log in, and enter the code to authorize the connection
8. Once approved, you will see **"Account linked"** under Lessons.church in B1 Admin

:::info
The Content Provider Accounts section is per ministry. If you run multiple ministries (e.g., Children's and Youth), you will need to link Lessons.church for each one separately.

## Step 2 — Schedule a Lesson

Once linked, you can schedule lessons directly from Plans.

1. In B1 Admin, go to **Serving → Plans**
2. Select your ministry tab and click **Add Plan** — the **Schedule Lesson** form opens
3. Select the **date** for the lesson (defaults to the upcoming Sunday)
4. Click **Select Lesson** — a content browser dialog opens
5. At the top of the dialog, confirm **Lessons.church** is selected as the provider
6. Browse through the content:
   - Select a **Program** (e.g., "Bible Stories for Kids")
   - Select a **Study** within that program (e.g., "Creation and Early Stories")
   - Select the specific **Lesson**
   - Select the **Venue** — this is the age-group version of the lesson (e.g., "Preschool", "Elementary")
7. Click **Associate Lesson** to confirm
8. Choose your **copy option** for volunteers:
   - **Nothing** — fresh plan, no volunteers carried over
   - **Positions Only** — copies volunteer roles from the previous plan but not who is assigned
   - **Positions and Assignments** — copies both roles and assigned volunteers *(most common)*
9. Click **Save**

The plan is created and named automatically (e.g., "Feb 23 - Elementary"). Volunteers can open the plan to see their assignments and review the lesson content before Sunday.

:::warning
Make sure to select the correct **Venue** for your classroom's age group. Choosing the wrong venue (e.g., Preschool content for an Elementary class) means your volunteers will see content designed for a different age level.

:::tip
**Plan ahead** — You can schedule multiple weeks of lessons at once so your team can prepare in advance. Use the past lesson list in the plan view to avoid accidentally repeating content.
