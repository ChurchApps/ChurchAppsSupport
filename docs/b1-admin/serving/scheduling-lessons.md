# Scheduling Lessons from Lessons.church

<div class="article-intro">

B1 Admin integrates directly with [Lessons.church](https://lessons.church) so you can schedule curriculum for your classrooms right inside your service plans. This keeps everything — volunteers, assignments, and lesson content — in one place.

</div>

<div class="prereqs">
<h4>Before You Begin</h4>

- Set up your ministries in the Serving area
- Have an active [Lessons.church](https://lessons.church) account — sign up there first if your church doesn't have one yet

</div>

## Step 1 — Link Your Lessons.church Account

This is a one-time setup per ministry. You need to connect your Lessons.church account before you can browse and schedule content.

1. Log in to [B1 Admin](https://admin.b1.church/) and go to **Serving**
2. Open the ministry you want to connect (e.g., Children's Ministry)
3. Scroll down to the **Content Provider Accounts** section
4. Click **Link New Provider**
5. Select **Lessons.church** from the list
6. A device authorization screen will appear with a code
7. Go to [lessons.church](https://lessons.church), log in, and enter the code to authorize the connection
8. Once approved, you will see **"Account linked"** under Lessons.church in B1 Admin

:::info
The Content Provider Accounts section is per ministry. If you run multiple ministries (e.g., Children's and Youth), you will need to link Lessons.church for each one separately.

## Step 2 — Schedule a Lesson

Once linked, you can schedule lessons directly from Plans.

1. In B1 Admin, go to **Serving → Plans**
2. Select your ministry tab and click **Add Plan** — the **Schedule Lesson** form opens
3. Select the **date** for the lesson (defaults to the upcoming Sunday)
4. Click **Select Lesson** — a content browser dialog opens
5. At the top of the dialog, confirm **Lessons.church** is selected as the provider
6. Browse through the content:
   - Select a **Program** (e.g., "Bible Stories for Kids")
   - Select a **Study** within that program (e.g., "Creation and Early Stories")
   - Select the specific **Lesson**
   - Select the **Venue** — this is the age-group version of the lesson (e.g., "Preschool", "Elementary")
7. Click **Associate Lesson** to confirm
8. Choose your **copy option** for volunteers:
   - **Nothing** — fresh plan, no volunteers carried over
   - **Positions Only** — copies volunteer roles from the previous plan but not who is assigned
   - **Positions and Assignments** — copies both roles and assigned volunteers *(most common)*
9. Click **Save**

The plan is created and named automatically (e.g., "Feb 23 - Elementary"). Volunteers can open the plan to see their assignments and review the lesson content before Sunday.

:::warning
Make sure to select the correct **Venue** for your classroom's age group. Choosing the wrong venue (e.g., Preschool content for an Elementary class) means your volunteers will see content designed for a different age level.
:::

:::tip
**Plan ahead** — You can schedule multiple weeks of lessons at once so your team can prepare in advance. Use the past lesson list in the plan view to avoid accidentally repeating content.

## Customizing Lesson Content

Once a lesson is scheduled, you can tailor it for your specific classroom — remove sections that don't apply, hide roles your room doesn't use, or reorder the content to match your preferred flow. Customizations can be saved for just one classroom or applied across all classrooms at your church.

See the [Customizing Lessons](/docs/lessons-church/customization/customizing-lessons) guide for step-by-step instructions.

## Playing Lessons on a Classroom TV with FreePlay

Scheduling a lesson in B1 Admin pairs perfectly with **[FreePlay](/docs/freeplay/)** — ChurchApps' free media player for classroom TVs and Fire Sticks. When your plan is set up, FreePlay can pull the lesson content directly from Lessons.church and play it full-screen in the classroom. Your teacher controls the pace with a TV remote, advancing through videos and slides as the lesson flows.

This means your volunteers see the plan on their phones while the content plays on the room's TV — no separate setup, no USB drives, no last-minute scrambling.

## Don't See Your Curriculum Provider?

The list of available providers is growing. If your church uses a curriculum provider that isn't showing in B1 Admin yet, reach out to us and we'll work on getting them added.

Feel free to copy and send the message below directly to your curriculum provider — once they reach out to us we'll get the integration set up:

---

> **Subject: ChurchApps Integration Request**
>
> Hi [Curriculum Provider Team],
>
> We love your curriculum and use it every week with our kids. We also use ChurchApps to manage our volunteers and service plans, and we use FreePlay (freeplay.church) to play lesson content directly on our classroom TVs. It has been a game changer for our teachers.
>
> Right now we have to manage your curriculum separately, but if you were integrated with ChurchApps we could schedule your lessons right inside our service plans and play them through FreePlay on our classroom screens — all without leaving the tools we already use.
>
> ChurchApps already works with several curriculum providers and their team is ready to work with you too. Could you reach out to them at **support@churchapps.org** to get the conversation started? We'd love to see this happen!
>
> Thank you!
