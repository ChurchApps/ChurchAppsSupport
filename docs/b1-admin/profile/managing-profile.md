# Managing Your Profile

The Profile page lets you edit your personal account settings. Your profile is shared across all ChurchApps products, so any changes you make here will be reflected everywhere you use ChurchApps.

## Profile Information

The top section of the Profile page contains your basic account details:

1. **Email** -- Your email address used for logging in and receiving notifications.
2. **First Name** and **Last Name** -- Your display name across ChurchApps.
3. **Password** -- Update your account password.

To update your information, edit the fields and click the **Save Changes** button.

## Changing Your Password

1. Scroll to the password fields on the Profile page.
2. Enter your new password in the **Password** field.
3. Re-enter it in the **Confirm Password** field.
4. Click **Save Changes**.

Your password must be at least 8 characters long. Make sure both the password and confirmation fields match exactly.

## Linked Accounts

The **Linked Accounts** section shows any external services connected to your ChurchApps account. You can view which accounts are linked and manage those connections from this section.

## Theme Preferences

ChurchApps supports both light and dark display modes:

1. Find the **Theme** toggle on your Profile page.
2. Switch between **Light** and **Dark** mode.
3. The interface will update immediately to reflect your choice.

Your theme preference is saved to your account and will apply across all your sessions.

## Account Deletion

At the bottom of the Profile page, you will find the option to permanently delete your account. This action removes your account and associated data and cannot be undone.

If you are a **Domain Admin**, make sure to transfer administrative responsibilities to another user before deleting your account.

Profile editing is disabled in demo mode. If you are using a demo account, you will not be able to make changes to your profile settings.
