## Viewing Your Devices

When you open the Devices page, you will see a table listing all registered devices with the following information:

- **Last Active Date** -- The most recent time the device connected to your account.

2. You will be prompted to enter a **pairing code**.
3. Find the pairing code displayed on the ChurchAppsPlayer device you want to connect.
4. Enter the code and confirm.
5. The device will appear in your devices table once successfully paired.

:::tip

## Editing a Device Label

1. Click the **device name** in the devices table.
2. Update the label to something descriptive (for example, "Sanctuary Main Screen" or "Lobby Display").
3. Save your changes.

:::tip
Using clear, descriptive labels makes it easy to identify which device is which, especially when you have multiple screens set up at your church.

## Managing Device Access

Use the Devices page to keep track of which devices have access to your church's streaming and content. If a device is no longer in use, you can remove it from your account to keep your device list clean and secure.

:::warning
Regularly review your connected devices to make sure only active, authorized devices are linked to your account. Remove any devices that are no longer in use to maintain security.
