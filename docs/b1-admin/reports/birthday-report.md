# Birthday Report

The Birthday Report helps you stay connected with your congregation by showing members with upcoming birthdays. Use it to plan celebrations, send cards, or make announcements during services.

## Running the Report

1. Navigate to **Reports** from the main menu.
2. Click the **Birthday Report** card.
3. Set the **date range** using the date filters to define which birthdays you want to see.
4. The report will display a list of members with birthdays in that range.

## What the Report Shows

The Birthday Report displays:

- **Member name** -- The person's name from your church database.
- **Birth date** -- The date of their birthday.

Results are listed within the date range you selected, making it easy to see who has a birthday coming up.

## Practical Uses

- **Weekly announcements** -- Run the report for the upcoming week and include birthdays in your bulletin or announcements.
- **Birthday cards** -- Generate a list for the month and have your team send personal birthday cards.
- **Small group leaders** -- Group leaders can run the report to remember birthdays of members in their group.
- **Milestone celebrations** -- Filter for specific date ranges to plan milestone birthday celebrations.

:::tip
Run this report at the beginning of each month to plan ahead. You can set the date range to cover the entire month so you have time to prepare cards or announcements.

Birthday data comes from the birth date field on each person's profile. Make sure your membership records are up to date for accurate results.
