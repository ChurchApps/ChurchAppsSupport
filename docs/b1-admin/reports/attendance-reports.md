# Attendance Reports

<div class="article-intro">

B1 Admin provides three attendance reports to help you understand how people are engaging with your services and groups. Each report offers a different perspective on your attendance data, from high-level trends to daily breakdowns.

</div>

<div class="prereqs">
<h4>Before You Begin</h4>

- Make sure attendance is being [tracked consistently](../attendance/tracking-attendance.md) for your services and groups
- Ensure your [groups](../groups/creating-groups.md) and services are configured in B1 Admin
- You need the appropriate [permissions](../settings/roles-permissions.md) to access reports

</div>

## Attendance Trend

The Attendance Trend report shows how attendance changes over time for your services.

1. Navigate to **Reports** and click the **Attendance Trend** card.
2. Set the **date range** to define the time period.
3. Select a **service** or **group** to filter the results.
4. The report displays a trend line showing attendance counts over the selected period.

This report is useful for spotting patterns like seasonal dips, growth trends, or the impact of special events.

## Group Attendance

The Group Attendance report shows attendance totals by group for a selected date range.

1. Navigate to **Reports** and click the **Group Attendance** card.
2. Set the **date range** for the report.
3. Select the **group(s)** you want to review.
4. The report displays total attendance figures for each group.

Use this report to compare attendance across groups and identify which groups are growing or need attention.

## Daily Group Attendance

The Daily Group Attendance report provides a day-by-day breakdown of attendance data for your groups.

1. Navigate to **Reports** and click the **Daily Group Attendance** card.
2. Set the **date range** for the report.
3. Select the **group(s)** you want to review.
4. The report shows attendance numbers for each individual day within the range.

This report gives you granular detail, which is helpful for understanding week-to-week variation or identifying specific days with unusually high or low attendance.

:::tip
Use the Attendance Trend report for a high-level overview and the Daily Group Attendance report when you need to drill into specific dates.

## Practical Uses

- **Planning** -- Use attendance trends to plan seating, staffing, and resources for upcoming services.
- **Outreach** -- Identify declining attendance patterns early so you can follow up with members.
- **Board reports** -- Include attendance data in your regular leadership reports to show ministry health.
- **Event evaluation** -- Compare attendance before and after special events to measure their impact.

:::warning
Attendance data is recorded through your group and service check-in processes. If attendance is not being tracked consistently, your reports will not accurately reflect actual participation. See [Tracking Attendance](../attendance/tracking-attendance.md) for setup instructions.
