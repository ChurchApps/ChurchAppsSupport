# Creating Calendars

<div class="article-intro">

Creating a calendar in B1 Admin gives you a central place to manage events for a ministry, department, or your entire church. Each calendar can pull in events from one or more groups, making it easy to keep everything organized.

</div>

<div class="prereqs">
<h4>Before You Begin</h4>

- Set up the [groups](../groups/creating-groups.md) whose events you want to include in your calendar
- You need administrative access to the Calendars section in B1 Admin

</div>

## Creating a New Calendar

1. Navigate to the **Calendars** section in B1 Admin.
2. Click **Add Calendar**.
3. Enter a **name** for your calendar (for example, "Youth Ministry Events" or "Main Church Calendar").
4. Add an optional **description** to help your team understand what this calendar is for.
5. Click **Create** to save your new calendar.

## The Calendar Detail Page

After creating a calendar, click on it to open the detail page. This page has two main areas:

- **Left column** -- The calendar and events editor. Here you can view, add, and manage events on your calendar.
- **Right column** -- The associated groups list. This shows which groups have events included in this calendar.

## Adding Events

1. On the calendar detail page, use the calendar editor on the left to add new events.
2. Set the event name, date, time, and any other details.
3. Events you add will appear on the calendar and can be published to your website.

## Connecting Groups

Groups that have events in the calendar automatically appear in the groups list on the right side of the detail page.

1. Click **Add** in the groups section to associate a group with your calendar.
2. Select the group from the dropdown.
3. Choose whether to include **all events** from that group or only **specific events**.
4. Click **Save**.

:::tip
Connecting groups to your calendar is a powerful way to automatically aggregate events. When a group leader adds an event to their [group](../groups/creating-groups.md), it can flow into your church-wide calendar without any extra work from you.

If you want to create a single calendar that pulls events from many groups across your church, see [Curated Calendar](curated-calendar) for a streamlined approach.
