# Curated Calendar

A curated calendar aggregates events from multiple groups into one unified calendar view. This is ideal for creating a church-wide calendar that shows everything happening across all your ministries and groups in a single place.

## Creating a Curated Calendar

1. From the B1 Admin, navigate to the **Website** section.
2. Click **Calendars** in the top navigation.
3. Click **Add Calendar** to create a new curated calendar.
4. Give your calendar a **name** (for example, "Church Events" or "This Week at Our Church").
5. Click **Create** to save it.

## Adding Groups to Your Calendar

1. Click on your new calendar to open it.
2. In the **Groups in Calendar** section on the right side, click **Add**.
3. Select a group from the dropdown menu.
4. Choose whether to add **all events** from that group or only **specific events**.
5. Click **Save**.
6. Repeat this process to add as many groups as you want to include.

## Sharing Your Calendar

Once your curated calendar is set up, you can share it in several ways:

- **Embed on your website** -- The calendar can be displayed directly on your B1.church website pages for visitors to browse.
- **Subscribe via ICS** -- Click **Subscribe** to copy the ICS link. Your congregation can paste this link into Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Outlook, or any other calendar app to stay in sync.
- **Download the ICS file** -- Download the calendar file to import it into a calendar application.

:::info
When group leaders add new events to their groups, those events automatically appear in your curated calendar. You do not need to manually update the curated calendar each time a new event is added.
