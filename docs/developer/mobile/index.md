# Mobile Apps

ChurchApps mobile apps are built with **React Native** and **Expo**, providing native experiences on Android, iOS, and Android TV.

## Apps

| App | Purpose | Platform |
|-----|---------|----------|
| [B1 Mobile](./b1-mobile) | Primary member-facing app for church members | Android, iOS |
| B1 Checkin | Kiosk app for check-in stations | Android, iOS |
| LessonsScreen | Android TV app for displaying lessons in classrooms | Android TV |

### B1 Mobile

The main church member app. Members can view directories, access giving, check attendance, receive notifications, and interact with their church community. See the [B1 Mobile setup guide](./b1-mobile) for details.

### B1 Checkin

A purpose-built kiosk application designed for check-in stations at churches. It provides a simple, touch-friendly interface for members to check in children and record attendance at services and events.

### LessonsScreen

An Android TV application that displays lesson content in classrooms. Teachers can push lesson slides, videos, and activities to a TV screen, making it easy to present curriculum material during classes.

All mobile apps share the same Expo-based toolchain and follow similar setup patterns. If you can build one, you can build them all.
