# Giving

B1 Mobile makes it easy to support your church with a full giving experience right from your phone. Whether you want to make a quick gift, review your giving history, or manage your payment methods, everything is available in one place.

## The Giving Tabs

The giving section is organized into four tabs:

- **Overview** -- A summary of your giving activity. See your year-to-date total, the number of gifts you have made, and details about your last donation, including a quick **Repeat** button to give the same amount again.
- **Donate** -- Make a new donation. Select a fund, enter an amount, and provide your payment details to complete a gift.
- **Manage** -- View and manage your saved payment methods. Add new cards or remove ones you no longer use.
- **History** -- A detailed list of all your past donations, so you can review your complete giving record.

## How Payments Work

All donations made through B1 Mobile are processed securely through **Stripe**. Your payment information is handled by Stripe's secure infrastructure and is never stored on ChurchApps servers. You can give with confidence knowing your financial details are protected.

## What You Can Do

Here is what you can do from the giving section:

- **Give to specific funds** -- Choose which fund to direct your donation to, such as a General Fund, Missions Fund, or Building Fund.
- **Review your giving** -- Check your year-to-date summary and browse your full donation history.
- **Save payment methods** -- Store your card details for faster giving in the future.
- **Repeat a gift** -- Quickly give the same amount as your last donation with a single tap.
