# Donation History

B1 Mobile gives you a clear picture of your giving through two tabs: **Overview** for a quick summary and **History** for a detailed record of every donation.

## Overview Tab

The **Overview** tab provides a snapshot of your giving activity at a glance. It shows:

- **Year-to-date total** -- The total amount you have given so far this year.
- **Number of gifts** -- How many individual donations you have made this year.
- **Last gift** -- Details about your most recent donation, including the amount and date.
- **Repeat button** -- A quick **Repeat** button next to your last gift lets you give the same amount again with just a tap. This is handy if you give the same amount regularly.

The Overview tab is a great starting point when you open the giving section. It tells you where you stand and makes it easy to give again right away.

## History Tab

The **History** tab shows a complete, detailed list of all your past donations. Each entry includes information such as:

- **Date** -- When the donation was made.
- **Fund** -- Which fund the donation was directed to.
- **Amount** -- The dollar amount of the donation.

Scroll through the list to review your full giving record. This is useful for keeping track of your generosity throughout the year or looking up a specific past donation.

Check the **Overview** tab regularly to stay on top of your giving goals. The year-to-date total makes it easy to see your progress at a glance.
