# Making a Donation

Giving through B1 Mobile is quick and straightforward. The **Donate** tab in the giving section walks you through the process in just a few steps.

## How to Give

1. Open the **Giving** section in B1 Mobile.
2. Tap the **Donate** tab.
3. Select the **fund** you would like to give to. Your church may have several funds available, such as a General Fund, Missions Fund, or Building Fund.
4. Enter the **amount** you would like to donate.
5. Provide your **payment details**. If you have a saved payment method, you can select it here. Otherwise, enter your card information.
6. Submit your donation.

After your donation is processed, you will see a confirmation that your gift was successful. The donation will also appear in your **History** tab.

## Secure Payments

All payments are processed through **Stripe**, a trusted and widely used payment platform. Your card details are handled securely by Stripe and are never stored on ChurchApps servers. You can give with confidence that your financial information is protected.

## Quick Repeat Giving

If you want to give the same amount as your last donation, you do not need to go through the full donation flow. The **Overview** tab shows your most recent gift along with a **Repeat** button. Tap it to quickly submit the same donation again.

If you plan to give regularly, save your payment method in the **Manage** tab so you can donate even faster next time.
