# Managing Payment Methods

The **Manage** tab in the giving section lets you view and manage your saved payment methods. By saving a card, you can make future donations faster without having to re-enter your details each time.

## Viewing Your Payment Methods

When you open the **Manage** tab, you will see a list of all your saved payment methods. Each entry shows the card type and the last four digits of the card number, so you can easily identify which card is which.

## Adding a New Payment Method

To add a new card:

1. Open the **Giving** section in B1 Mobile.
2. Tap the **Manage** tab.
3. Tap the option to add a new payment method.
4. Enter your card details. The information is sent securely to Stripe for processing.
5. Once saved, the new card will appear in your list of payment methods.

Your saved card will then be available as a payment option the next time you make a donation from the **Donate** tab.

## Removing a Payment Method

If you no longer want a card on file, you can remove it from the **Manage** tab:

1. Find the card you want to remove in your list of saved payment methods.
2. Tap the remove or delete option next to the card.
3. Confirm the removal.

The card will no longer appear as a payment option when you make a donation.

:::note
Removing a payment method does not affect any past donations. Your donation history remains unchanged.
