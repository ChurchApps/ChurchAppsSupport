# Notifications

<div class="article-intro">

B1 Mobile uses push notifications to keep you informed about what is happening at your church. Instead of having to open the app to check for updates, important information comes to you automatically.

</div>

<div class="prereqs">
<h4>Before You Begin</h4>

- [Install B1 Mobile](../getting-started/installing) and [log in](../getting-started/logging-in) to your account
- Allow notifications for B1 Mobile in your device settings

</div>

## What You Will Be Notified About

Notifications can cover a range of activity, including:

- **Messages** -- When someone sends you a [private message](./messaging).
- **Group activity** -- Updates, posts, and conversations from [groups](../groups/) you belong to.
- **Serving assignments** -- When you are assigned to a [plan](../serving/viewing-plans.md) or when your assignment status changes.
- **Other updates** -- General announcements and activity relevant to you.

## Viewing Your Notifications

1. Tap the **bell icon** in the top-right corner of the app, or tap the **Notifications** option in the navigation.
2. The notifications screen shows all of your recent notifications in a tabbed view, organized so you can quickly find what you are looking for.

Each notification includes a brief summary of the update. Tap on any notification to go directly to the relevant content -- for example, tapping a message notification opens the conversation, and tapping a serving notification takes you to the plan.

## Push Notifications

B1 Mobile sends push notifications to your device so you receive updates even when the app is not open. To receive push notifications, make sure you have allowed notifications for B1 Mobile in your device settings.

### Enabling Push Notifications

- **iOS** -- Go to **Settings** > **Notifications** > **B1 Mobile** and toggle **Allow Notifications** on.
- **Android** -- Go to **Settings** > **Apps** > **B1 Mobile** > **Notifications** and make sure notifications are enabled.

:::warning
If you are not receiving notifications, check your device settings to make sure they are enabled. Also confirm that you are logged in to the app, since notifications are tied to your account.

:::tip
You can manage notification preferences at the device level. If you find notifications too frequent, adjust your device settings to control how and when alerts appear.
