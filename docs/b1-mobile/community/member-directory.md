# Member Directory

<div class="article-intro">

The member directory in B1 Mobile lets you browse and search for people in your church. Whether you need to look up a fellow group member or find someone you met on Sunday, the directory makes it easy to connect.

</div>

<div class="prereqs">
<h4>Before You Begin</h4>

- [Install B1 Mobile](../getting-started/installing) and [log in](../getting-started/logging-in) to your account

</div>

## Accessing the Directory

1. Tap the **Directory** option in the app navigation.
2. The directory loads with your church's members listed alphabetically.

## Browsing the Directory

Members are indexed alphabetically by last name and organized under letter headings (A, B, C, and so on). You can scroll through the list to browse your church family. Each entry shows the member's name and photo, making it easy to find who you are looking for.

## Searching for Members

If you know who you are looking for, the search bar at the top of the directory is the fastest way to find them.

1. Tap the **search bar** at the top of the screen.
2. Type in a name.
3. The list filters in real time to show matching results.

:::tip
This is especially helpful in larger churches where scrolling through the full list would take a while. Just type the first few letters of a name to quickly narrow down the results.

## Viewing a Member Profile

Tap on any member in the list to open their profile. The profile page may include:

- **Contact information** -- Phone number, email address, and other details your church has made available.
- **Family connections** -- [Household members](../profile/household.md) linked to this person's profile. You can tap on a family member to navigate to their profile as well.

:::info
The information visible in each profile depends on your church's privacy and directory settings. Not all fields may be shown for every member. Members can control their own visibility from [Privacy Settings](../profile/privacy-settings.md). If you have questions about what is shared, contact your church administrator.
