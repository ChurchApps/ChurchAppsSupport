# Messaging

<div class="article-intro">

B1 Mobile includes private messaging so you can have one-on-one conversations with other church members directly from the app. It is a simple way to stay in touch without needing to share personal phone numbers or email addresses.

## Accessing Your Messages

1. Tap **Messaging** in the app navigation.
2. Your previous conversations are listed for quick access.

## Starting a New Conversation

1. From the messaging screen, tap the option to start a new conversation.
2. Use the search field to find the member you want to message. You can also find members through the [Member Directory](./member-directory).
3. Select the member from the search results.
4. Type your message and tap **Send**.

Your new conversation will now appear in your conversation list so you can easily pick it up later.

## Reading and Sending Messages

When you open a conversation, you will see the full message thread. Each message shows the sender's avatar and name, so it is easy to follow along. To reply, type your message in the text field at the bottom of the screen and tap **Send**.

## Editing Messages

If you need to correct something after sending a message, you can edit it. Tap on the message you want to change, select the edit option, make your correction, and save. The updated message will replace the original in the conversation.

## Your Conversation List

All of your active conversations appear in a list on the main messaging screen. The list shows the other person's name and avatar, making it easy to find the conversation you are looking for. Tap on any conversation to open it and continue where you left off.

Use messaging to coordinate with fellow volunteers, follow up with someone you met at church, or just check in on a friend. It keeps your church communications in one convenient place.
