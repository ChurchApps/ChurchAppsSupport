# Community

<div class="article-intro">

The **Community** features in B1 Mobile help you stay connected with your church family right from your phone. Whether you need to look up a fellow member, send a quick message, or check your latest notifications, everything is just a tap away.

</div>

## What You Will Find

- **[Member Directory](./member-directory)** -- Browse and search your church's member directory. Look up people by name and tap on a member to view their profile with contact information and family connections.
- **[Messaging](./messaging)** -- Send and receive private messages with other church members. Start new conversations or pick up where you left off with existing ones.
- **[Notifications](./notifications)** -- Stay updated with push notifications about group activity, messages, serving assignments, and other important updates from your church.

## Getting Started

You must be logged in to access community features. If you are not signed in, you will be prompted to [log in](../getting-started/logging-in) when you try to use any of these sections.

The member directory, messaging, and notifications are each accessible from the app's navigation. Together, they give you a simple way to find people, communicate privately, and stay in the loop with what is happening at your church.

:::info
The members and information visible to you in the directory depend on your church's privacy settings. You can control your own visibility from the [Privacy Settings](../profile/privacy-settings.md) screen. If you have questions about what is shared, contact your church administrator.
