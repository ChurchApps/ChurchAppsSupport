# B1 Mobile

<div class="article-intro">

B1 Mobile is the companion app for B1.church, available on iOS and Android. It gives church members on-the-go access to all the tools your church provides -- groups, giving, check-in, serving plans, the member directory, private messaging, sermons, Bible, verse of the day, lessons, and more.

</div>

The app uses your ChurchApps account, the same one you use on B1.church. After logging in and selecting your church, the app adapts to your church's branding and configuration. If you belong to multiple churches, you can switch between them at any time.

B1 Mobile supports push notifications so you never miss an important update from your church or groups. The home dashboard personalizes itself based on your usage -- the features you visit most often are promoted to the top for quick access.
