# Check-In

B1 Mobile lets you check in yourself and your household members for church services right from your phone. Skip the line at the kiosk and record your attendance before you even walk through the doors.

## How It Works

The check-in process is a quick, multi-step flow that guides you through selecting a service, choosing who is attending, and assigning each person to a group. Once you confirm, your attendance is recorded automatically.

## Getting Started

To access check-in, open the **Check-In** section in B1 Mobile. You must be logged in to use this feature. If you are not signed in, you will be prompted to log in first.

The check-in feature requires that your church has set up services and attendance groups in their administration settings. If no services appear when you open the check-in screen, your church may not have this feature configured yet. Contact your church administrator for help.

## What You Can Do

- **Choose services and times** -- Pick from the available services and time slots that your church has configured.
- **Assign groups** -- Place each person in the appropriate group for the service, such as Main Worship, Kids Room, or Youth Group.
