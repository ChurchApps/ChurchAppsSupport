# Self Check-In

Checking in from B1 Mobile is a straightforward, multi-step process. In just a few taps, you can record attendance for yourself and your household members.

## The Check-In Flow

### Step 1: Select a Service and Time

When you open the check-in screen, you will see a list of available services and times. These are configured by your church and may include options like "Sunday Morning 9:00 AM" or "Wednesday Evening 6:30 PM."

1. Review the available service options.
2. Tap the service and time you are attending.

### Step 2: Select Household Members

After choosing a service, you will see a list of the members in your household.

1. Review the list of household members.
2. Select each person who will be attending the service.

You do not need to check in everyone -- only select the people who are actually present.

### Step 3: Assign Groups

For each person you selected, you will assign them to a group for the service. Groups might include options like Main Worship, Kids Room 1, Kids Room 2, or Youth Group.

1. For each selected household member, tap to choose the appropriate **group**.
2. Make sure each person is assigned to the correct group for their age or role.

### Step 4: Confirmation

Once you have assigned groups for everyone who is attending, complete the check-in.

1. Review your selections to make sure everything looks correct.
2. Confirm the check-in.
3. You will see a confirmation screen letting you know that your attendance has been recorded.

## Things to Know

- You can only check in household members that are linked to your account. If someone is missing from the list, ask your church administrator to add them to your household.
- If no services appear on the check-in screen, your church may not have any services configured for check-in at this time.
- If you need to change a selection before confirming, you can go back and adjust your choices.
