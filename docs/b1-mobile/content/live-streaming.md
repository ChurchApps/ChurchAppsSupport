# Live Streaming

B1 Mobile lets you watch your church's live stream directly from your phone. When a service is broadcasting, you can tune in from wherever you are and watch in real time.

## Watching a Live Stream

1. Open the **Stream** screen from the drawer menu, or tap the countdown on the **Sermons** screen when a live stream is about to begin.
2. If a service is currently live, the video player loads automatically and the broadcast begins playing.
3. Watch the stream directly in the app.

When no live stream is currently active, the screen may show offline content or information about the next scheduled service.

## Getting to the Stream

There are two ways to access the live stream:

- **Drawer menu** -- Open the drawer menu and tap **Stream** to go directly to the live stream screen.
- **Sermons screen** -- When a live stream is scheduled within the next 24 hours, a countdown appears on the Sermons screen. Once the broadcast begins, you can navigate to the stream from there.

## Before and After the Service

Your church sets specific times for when the stream becomes available. You may see a countdown or offline message before the service starts. After the broadcast ends, the stream screen returns to its offline state.

If the stream screen shows a countdown or offline message, the next scheduled service has not started yet. Check back at the listed service time.

## Availability

The live stream screen is available when your church has configured a streaming schedule. If you do not see a Stream option in your app's drawer menu, your church may not have live streaming set up. Contact your church administrator for details.
