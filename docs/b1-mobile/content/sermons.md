# Sermons

<div class="article-intro">

The Sermons screen lets you browse and watch recorded sermons from your church. It is your go-to spot for catching up on messages you missed or revisiting a sermon that spoke to you.

</div>

<div class="prereqs">
<h4>Before You Begin</h4>

- [Install B1 Mobile](../getting-started/installing) and [log in](../getting-started/logging-in) to your account
- Your church must have sermon content configured in their admin portal

</div>

## What You Will See

The Sermons screen is organized into a tabbed view with two main sections:

- **Playlists tab** -- Shows your church's sermon playlists (series), sorted by date. Each playlist groups related sermons together, making it easy to follow a multi-week series from start to finish.
- **Recent tab** -- Shows a list of individual sermons in reverse chronological order, so the newest messages are always at the top.

At the top of the screen, the most recent sermon is displayed as a featured card, giving you quick access to the latest message.

## Live Stream Countdown

When a [live stream](./live-streaming) is coming up within the next 24 hours, a countdown timer appears on the Sermons screen. This lets you know when the next service will be broadcasting so you can plan to watch live.

## Watching a Sermon

1. Open the **Sermons** screen from the drawer menu.
2. Browse the **Playlists** or **Recent** tab to find the sermon you want.
3. Tap a sermon to open it and start watching.

You can also tap a playlist to see all the sermons in that series, then select the specific sermon you would like to watch.

Sermons may include video or audio content hosted on platforms like YouTube, Vimeo, or Facebook. When you tap a sermon, the media plays directly within the app.

## What Each Sermon Shows

Each sermon entry can display:

- **Title** -- The name of the sermon
- **Speaker** -- Who delivered the message
- **Date** -- When the sermon was recorded or published
- **Thumbnail** -- A preview image for the sermon

:::tip
If you see a countdown on the Sermons screen, tap it to jump straight to the [live stream](./live-streaming) when it starts.

## Availability

The Sermons screen is available when your church has added sermon content through their admin portal. If you do not see **Sermons** in your app, your church may not have this feature configured yet.
