# Verse of the Day

The Verse of the Day screen displays a daily Bible verse as a beautifully formatted image. It is a simple way to start your day with Scripture or find a moment of encouragement whenever you open the app.

## Viewing the Verse

1. Open the **Verse of the Day** screen from the drawer menu.
2. The screen displays today's verse as a styled image.
3. A new verse appears automatically each day.

There is nothing you need to do -- just open the screen and the current day's verse will be shown.

## Responsive Display

The verse image automatically adjusts to fit your device's screen orientation. Depending on how you are holding your phone or tablet, you will see one of three formats:

- **Portrait (9:16)** -- Optimized for phones held vertically
- **Landscape (16:9)** -- Best for tablets or phones held horizontally
- **Square (1:1)** -- Used when your screen dimensions are close to equal

The app detects your screen orientation and selects the best format, so the verse always looks good regardless of how you are viewing it. If you rotate your device, the image updates to match the new orientation.

## Availability

The Verse of the Day is a built-in content feature of B1 Mobile. If you do not see it in the drawer menu, your church administrator may not have added it to the app. Contact your church administrator to request it.
