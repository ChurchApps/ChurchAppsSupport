# Lessons

The Lessons screen gives you access to your church's curriculum and learning materials. Content is provided through the Lessons.church platform and is embedded directly within B1 Mobile, so you can browse and view lessons without switching to another app.

## Accessing Lessons

1. Open the **Lessons** screen from the drawer menu.
2. The Lessons.church content loads directly within the app.
3. Browse the curriculum your church has made available.

Your church configures which lessons and programs appear here. You will see the content that has been scheduled or assigned by your church's team.

## What You Can Do

Once inside the Lessons screen, you can browse and view the materials your church has set up. Depending on what your church has configured, you may find:

- **Lesson plans** -- Structured outlines with sections and activities
- **Presentations and media** -- Slides, videos, and images to accompany lessons
- **Downloadable resources** -- Files and materials for further study

Tap on individual sections within a lesson to view their content. Use the navigation controls to move between sections or return to the lesson list.

Lessons.church is a separate ChurchApps platform that integrates with B1 Mobile. Your church administrator manages the lesson content through the Lessons.church portal.

## Availability
