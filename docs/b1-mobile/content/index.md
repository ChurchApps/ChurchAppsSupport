# Content

<div class="article-intro">

B1 Mobile gives you a central place to access all the content your church shares, right from your phone. Depending on what your church has configured, you may have access to sermons, live streaming, Bible reading, a daily verse, and lesson materials -- all without leaving the app.

</div>

## Available Content Features

### Sermons

Browse and watch recorded sermons from your church. Sermons are organized into playlists and series so you can easily find past messages or follow along with a current series.

### Live Streaming

Watch your church's live broadcast directly in the app. When a service is streaming, you can tune in and watch from wherever you are.

### Bible

Read Scripture using the built-in Bible reader. Navigate through books, chapters, and verses without switching apps.

### Verse of the Day

View a beautifully formatted Bible verse image that changes every day. The image automatically adjusts to fit your device's screen orientation.

### Lessons

Access your church's curriculum and learning materials through the embedded Lessons.church platform. Browse and view scheduled lessons right inside B1 Mobile.

## Finding Content

Content features are available through the drawer menu in the app. Your church administrator decides which content features are enabled, so you may not see all of the options listed above. If a particular feature is missing, your church may not have it configured yet.

:::info
Content features are configured by your church administrator through [B1 Admin](../../b1-admin/). If you do not see a feature you expect, contact your church office.
