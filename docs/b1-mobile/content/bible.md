# Bible

B1 Mobile includes a built-in Bible reader so you can read Scripture right from the app. The reader is embedded directly in the Bible screen, giving you quick access to any passage without switching to another app.

## Reading the Bible

1. Open the **Bible** screen from the drawer menu.
2. The reader loads with a default passage.
3. Use the navigation controls within the reader to move to a different book, chapter, or verse.

The Bible reader is powered by YouVersion or an alternative provider configured by your church. The reading experience works the same way regardless of which provider is used.

## Navigating Passages

The embedded reader provides controls for moving through Scripture. You can:

- Browse to a specific book of the Bible
- Jump to a particular chapter
- Scroll through verses within a chapter

The reader fills the screen, giving you plenty of space to read comfortably on your device.

:::tip
Make the Bible screen part of your daily routine -- it is a quick way to read Scripture wherever you are.

## Availability

The Bible screen is available when your church has enabled this feature. If you do not see a Bible option in the drawer menu, your church administrator may not have added it to the app. Contact your church administrator to request it.
