# Serving

<div class="article-intro">

The **Serving** section in B1 Mobile gives you a quick and easy way to stay on top of your serving commitments. Whether you are on the worship team, greeting at the door, or helping with kids ministry, this is where you can see when you are scheduled and what your role is.

## What You Will Find

- **Upcoming assignments** -- See all of your future serving times at a glance so you always know when you are needed next.
- **Past service history** -- Review the services you have already served in to keep track of your involvement over time.
- **Position assignments** -- Each assignment shows the position you have been given along with its current status -- whether it is requested, confirmed, or pending your response.

## Getting Started

To view your serving schedule, tap **Serving** in the bottom navigation of the app. You must be logged in to access your assignments. If you are not signed in, you will be prompted to [log in](../getting-started/logging-in) first.

You will only see plans that you have been assigned to. If you do not see any assignments, it means you have not been added to a serving team yet. Reach out to your church administrator or ministry leader to get involved.
