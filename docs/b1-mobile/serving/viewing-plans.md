# Viewing Plans

The plans screen in B1 Mobile gives you a complete picture of your serving schedule. It is organized into two tabs so you can quickly find your next assignment or look back at your service history.

## Accessing Your Plans

1. Tap **Serving** in the bottom navigation.
2. The plans screen opens with two tabs at the top: **Upcoming** and **Past**.

## The Upcoming Tab

The **Upcoming** tab is your go-to view for what is coming next. At the top you will see a hero card highlighting your very next assignment, including the plan name, date, and your position. This makes it easy to know at a glance when you are needed.

Below the hero card, you will find a set of summary stats showing how many of your assignments are in each status:

- **Requested** -- You have been asked to serve but have not yet responded.
- **Confirmed** -- You have accepted the assignment.
- **Pending** -- The assignment is awaiting further action.

Further down the screen, a table lists all of your upcoming serving times with their dates, positions, and statuses.

## The Past Tab

Tap the **Past** tab to switch to your service history. This view shows all of the plans you have previously served in, listed in reverse chronological order. It is a great way to keep track of your contributions over time.

## Viewing Plan Details

Tap on any plan -- whether upcoming or past -- to open its full details. The detail view includes:

- **Service order** -- The complete order of service with timing and item details so you can see the flow of the service.
- **Your assignment** -- Your position, the time you are needed, and your current status.
- **Team assignments** -- A summary of everyone serving in the plan, so you can see who else is on the team.

:::tip
Check the **Upcoming** tab regularly to stay on top of your schedule. The hero card always shows your very next commitment, so you can open the app and know right away when you are serving next.
