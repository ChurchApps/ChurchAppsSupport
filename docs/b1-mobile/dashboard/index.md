# Dashboard

The dashboard is your home screen in B1 Mobile. It gives you quick access to the features your church offers, organized based on how you use the app.

## Welcome Section

At the top of the dashboard, you will see a welcome message along with your church's logo (or church name if no logo is set) and a "stay connected" tagline. This section confirms which church you are currently viewing.

## Featured Links

Below the welcome section, your most-visited feature appears as a large **hero card** with a background image and the feature name. This is the feature you use most often, promoted to the top for one-tap access.

## Featured Cards

Beneath the hero card, you will see up to two **featured cards** displayed side by side. These represent your second and third most-visited features. Each card shows a background image and feature name. Tap either card to go directly to that feature.

## Quick Actions

The remaining features appear in a **Quick Actions** grid below the featured cards. Each item shows an icon and label. These are all the other navigation links your church has configured, giving you access to everything from groups and giving to check-in, sermons, and more.

## How the Layout Adapts

The dashboard layout is personalized based on your usage patterns. Every time you tap a feature, the app tracks how often you visit it. Features you use more frequently move toward the top of the dashboard:

- Your **most-visited** feature becomes the hero card.
- Your **second and third most-visited** features become the featured cards.
- **Everything else** appears in the Quick Actions grid.

If you have not used the app yet, features appear in the default order your church has configured. Over time, the dashboard reshuffles to match your habits.

## Refreshing the Dashboard

Pull down on the dashboard to refresh it. This reloads your church's links and content to make sure you are seeing the latest information.

## Navigation

From the dashboard, you can reach any part of the app:

- Tap the **hamburger icon** (three horizontal lines) in the top-left corner to open the drawer menu with all navigation options.
- Tap the **bell icon** in the top-right corner to view your notifications.
- Tap any card or quick action item to go directly to that feature.
