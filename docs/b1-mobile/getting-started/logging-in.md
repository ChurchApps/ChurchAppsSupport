# Logging In

B1 Mobile uses the same ChurchApps account you use on B1.church and other ChurchApps products. If you already have an account, you can sign in with your existing email and password.

## How to Log In

1. Open the B1 Mobile app.
2. Tap the **Login** option from the drawer menu or the login prompt.
3. Enter your **email address** and **password**.
4. Tap **Sign In**.

After signing in, you will be taken to the dashboard. If you have not selected a church yet, you will be prompted to search for and select one.

## Creating a New Account

If you do not have a ChurchApps account yet, you can create one directly in the app:

1. On the login screen, tap the **Register** link at the bottom.
2. Enter your **first name**, **last name**, and **email address**.
3. Tap **Register**.
4. Check your email for a message with your temporary password.
5. Return to the app, tap **Login**, and sign in with your email and the temporary password from the email.

After your first login, you can change your password from your profile settings.

## Forgot Your Password

If you have forgotten your password, tap **Forgot Password?** on the login screen. This opens a page in your browser where you can enter your email address and request a password reset link.

## Staying Logged In

B1 Mobile keeps you signed in between sessions. You do not need to log in every time you open the app. If you are signed out for any reason, simply log in again with your email and password.

## Logging Out

To log out of the app:

1. Open the drawer menu by tapping the **hamburger icon** (three horizontal lines) in the top-left corner.
2. Scroll to the bottom of the drawer menu.
3. Tap **Sign Out**.

You will be signed out and can log in again at any time with your credentials.
