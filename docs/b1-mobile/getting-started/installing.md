# Installing the App

<div class="article-intro">

B1 Mobile is available for both iOS and Android devices. The app is free to download and only takes a moment to install so you can start connecting with your church.

</div>

## Download

- **iOS** -- Open the **App Store** on your iPhone or iPad and search for **B1.church**. Tap **Get** to download and install.
- **Android** -- Open the **Google Play Store** on your Android device and search for **B1.church**. Tap **Install** to download and install.

You can also search for "B1 Mobile" if the first search does not return results.

## After Installing

Once the app is installed, open it from your home screen. You will see the church search screen where you can find and select your church. If you already have a ChurchApps account, you can [log in](./logging-in) right away. If not, you can create an account from the login screen.

The app will ask for permission to send push notifications. We recommend allowing notifications so you can receive updates from your church and groups.

:::tip
Allow push notifications when prompted during setup. This ensures you receive timely updates about [group activity](../groups/group-timeline.md), [messages](../community/messaging.md), and [serving assignments](../serving/viewing-plans.md).

## Updating the App

B1 Mobile receives regular updates with new features and improvements. Your device should update the app automatically, but you can also check for updates manually:

1. Open the **App Store** (iOS) or **Google Play Store** (Android).
2. Search for **B1.church**.
3. If an update is available, tap **Update**.

:::info
B1 Mobile requires iOS 14 or later for Apple devices and Android 6.0 or later for Android devices.
