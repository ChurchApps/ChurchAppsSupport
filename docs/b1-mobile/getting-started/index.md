# Getting Started

<div class="article-intro">

Getting started with B1 Mobile takes just a few minutes. Download the app, sign in with your ChurchApps account, select your church, and you are ready to go.

</div>

## Quick Start

1. **Download** the app from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com) (iOS) or [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com) (Android). Search for "B1.church".
2. **Log in** with your existing ChurchApps account -- the same email and password you use on B1.church. If you do not have an account yet, tap **Register** to create one.
3. **Select your church** by searching for it by name. Type at least 3 characters to see results.
4. **Explore the dashboard** -- your personalized home screen shows quick links to the features your church offers.

That is it. Once you have selected your church, the app loads your church's branding, navigation links, and content. You can start using groups, giving, check-in, and everything else your church has enabled.
