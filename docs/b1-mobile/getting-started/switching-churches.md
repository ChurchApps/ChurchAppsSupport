# Switching Churches

<div class="article-intro">

If you are a member of more than one church, B1 Mobile makes it easy to switch between them. Your account works across all churches that use ChurchApps, so you only need one login.

## How to Switch Churches

1. Open the drawer menu by tapping the **hamburger icon** (three horizontal lines) in the top-left corner.
2. In the drawer header, tap the button showing your current church name (or **Find a Church** if no church is selected).
3. The **Church Search** screen appears. Your recently visited churches are shown at the top for quick access.
4. Tap a recent church to switch to it, or type in the search field to find a different church.

When you switch churches, the app reloads with that church's branding, navigation links, and content. Your [dashboard](../dashboard/), [groups](../groups/), and other data will reflect the newly selected church.

## Searching for a Church

On the Church Search screen, type at least 3 characters of the church name into the search field. Matching churches appear in a list below. Tap a church to select it.

:::info
If no results appear, try a different spelling or a shorter portion of the church name. The search matches against church names registered with ChurchApps.

## Recent Churches

The Church Search screen remembers churches you have visited before. When you have not typed a search query, your recent churches are displayed automatically. This makes it quick to switch back to a church you use regularly.

:::tip
You do not need to log out and log back in to switch churches. Your single ChurchApps account works across all your churches. Just select a different church from the Church Search screen and you are ready to go.
