# Group Details

When you tap a group from the Groups screen, you are taken to that group's detail page. This is where you can see everything about the group and interact with its content.

## What You Will See

The group detail page gives you a full profile of the group:

- **Group info** -- The group's name, description, meeting details, and any other information the group leaders have provided.
- **Posts and timeline** -- A feed of posts and activity specific to this group. You can see what leaders and members have shared, including updates, announcements, and conversations.
- **Members** -- View who belongs to the group. This helps you see who you are connecting with and recognize familiar faces.

## Interacting with Group Content

From the group detail page, you can engage with the group in several ways:

- **Read posts** -- Scroll through the group's timeline to catch up on the latest activity.
- **View member profiles** -- Tap on a member to see their profile information.
- **Stay informed** -- Check back regularly to see new posts, announcements, and updates from your group leaders and fellow members.

## Getting There

1. Open the **Groups** screen in B1 Mobile.
2. Tap on any group -- your hero group, a featured card, or any group in the list.
3. The group's detail page opens with all of its content and information.

Your most-visited group appears as the hero card at the top of the Groups screen, so getting to your favorite group is always just one tap away.
