# Group Details

<div class="article-intro">

When you tap a group from the Groups screen, you are taken to that group's detail page. This is where you can see everything about the group and interact with its content, including posts, member lists, and group information.

</div>

<div class="prereqs">
<h4>Before You Begin</h4>

- [Install B1 Mobile](../getting-started/installing) and [log in](../getting-started/logging-in) to your account
- Open the [Groups](./index.md) screen

</div>

## What You Will See

The group detail page gives you a full profile of the group:

- **Group info** -- The group's name, description, meeting details, and any other information the group leaders have provided.
- **Posts and timeline** -- A feed of posts and activity specific to this group. You can see what leaders and members have shared, including updates, announcements, and conversations.
- **Members** -- View who belongs to the group. This helps you see who you are connecting with and recognize familiar faces.

## Interacting with Group Content

From the group detail page, you can engage with the group in several ways:

- **Read posts** -- Scroll through the group's timeline to catch up on the latest activity.
- **View member profiles** -- Tap on a member to see their profile information in the [member directory](../community/member-directory.md).
- **Stay informed** -- Check back regularly to see new posts, announcements, and updates from your group leaders and fellow members.

## Getting There

1. Open the **Groups** screen in B1 Mobile.
2. Tap on any group -- your hero group, a featured card, or any group in the list.
3. The group's detail page opens with all of its content and information.

Your most-visited group appears as the hero card at the top of the Groups screen, so getting to your favorite group is always just one tap away.
