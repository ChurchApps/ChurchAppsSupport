# Groups

Groups in B1 Mobile help you stay connected with the people and ministries that matter to you. Whether you belong to a small group, a Bible study, a volunteer team, or a ministry, the Groups screen is your hub for everything happening in your church community.

## What You Will See

When you open the **Groups** screen, your groups are organized by how often you visit them:

- **Hero group** -- Your most-visited group is displayed prominently at the top of the screen as a large hero card. Tap it to jump straight into that group's detail page.
- **Featured groups** -- Your next most-visited groups appear as featured cards just below the hero. These give you quick access to the groups you engage with most.
- **All groups** -- Below the featured section, you can browse the rest of your church's groups.

This layout makes it easy to get to the groups you care about most with a single tap, while still giving you access to everything else.

## What You Can Do

Here is what you can do from the Groups screen:

- **Browse groups** -- Scroll through your church's available groups and discover new ones to join.
- **View group details** -- Tap any group to see its full profile, including posts, members, and group information.
- **Follow the timeline** -- A unified timeline feed shows posts and activity from all your groups in one place, so you never miss an update.
- **Stay connected** -- See what your group members are sharing, keep up with conversations, and engage with group content.
