# Group Timeline

<div class="article-intro">

The Groups screen in B1 Mobile includes a timeline feed that pulls together activity from all of your groups into one unified stream. Instead of checking each group individually, you can scroll through a single feed to see everything that is happening.

</div>

<div class="prereqs">
<h4>Before You Begin</h4>

- [Install B1 Mobile](../getting-started/installing) and [log in](../getting-started/logging-in) to your account
- Be a member of at least one group at your church

</div>

## How It Works

The group timeline merges posts, conversations, and updates from every group you belong to. As group leaders and members share content, it appears in the timeline in chronological order. This means you get a complete picture of your group life without switching between different groups.

## What Appears in the Timeline

The timeline includes a variety of content from across your groups:

- **Posts** -- Messages and updates shared by group leaders and members.
- **Conversations** -- Ongoing discussions happening within your groups.
- **Updates** -- Announcements, event reminders, and other activity from your groups.

Each item in the timeline shows which group it came from, so you always know the context of what you are reading.

## Staying Up to Date

The timeline is a great way to stay connected with your church community at a glance. Here are a few tips for getting the most out of it:

- **Check in regularly** -- Open the Groups screen and scroll through the timeline to catch up on recent activity.
- **Tap for more** -- If a post catches your eye, tap it or tap the group name to go to the full [group detail page](./group-details) for more context.
- **Everything in one place** -- You do not need to visit each group separately. The timeline brings all the activity to you.

:::info
The timeline only shows activity from groups associated with your church. If you do not see any posts, it may mean your groups have not had recent activity, or you may not be a member of any groups yet.

:::tip
Enable [push notifications](../community/notifications.md) to get alerted when new posts appear in your groups, even when you are not in the app.
