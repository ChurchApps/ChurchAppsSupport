# Household

The **Household** tab on your Profile screen shows your family members. This is where you can see who is part of your household and how the members are connected.

## What You Will See

When you open the **Household** tab, you will see a list of the people in your household. Each member's entry shows:

- **Name** -- The person's first and last name
- **Role** -- Their role within the household (such as Head or Other)
- **Profile photo** -- Their picture, if one has been uploaded

Your household is a shared group that ties your family members together within the church's system.

## Why Household Matters

Your household information is used by several features in B1 Mobile and across ChurchApps:

- **Check-in** -- When you check in for a service or event, you can check in your entire household at once instead of checking in each person individually.
- **Church records** -- Your church uses household data to keep family records organized and to communicate with your family as a unit.
- **Directory** -- Other members may see your household information in the church directory, depending on your privacy settings.

## Viewing Your Household

1. Open the drawer menu and tap **Profile**.
2. Select the **Household** tab.
3. Browse the list of family members in your household.

:::note
Household membership is typically managed by your church administrator. If you need to add or remove someone from your household, contact your church office for assistance.

## Keeping Information Current

If a family member's details need updating, they can edit their own profile, or you can reach out to your church administrator to make changes. Keeping household information accurate ensures features like check-in work smoothly for your whole family.
