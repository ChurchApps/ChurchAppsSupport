# Privacy Settings

The **Visibility** tab on your Profile screen lets you control what other church members can see about you in the directory. You decide which personal details are shared publicly and which remain private.

## Controlling Your Visibility

1. Open the drawer menu and tap **Profile**.
2. Select the **Visibility** tab.
3. Review each field and choose whether it is visible to other members.
4. Save your changes.

You can control visibility for details such as:

- **Phone number** -- Whether other members can see your phone number
- **Email address** -- Whether your email is displayed in the directory
- **Address** -- Whether your home address is visible to others

By default, your church may have certain fields visible or hidden. You can adjust these settings at any time to match your comfort level.

If you are unsure what others can see, visit the **Visibility** tab and review your current settings. You can always make changes later.

## Pending Changes

The **Pending** tab shows any profile updates you have submitted that are waiting for admin approval. Some churches require an administrator to review and approve certain changes before they take effect. If you have made a change that requires approval, you will see it listed here along with its current status.

## Account Settings

The **Account** tab provides access to your security settings. Use this tab to manage settings related to your account access and security.
