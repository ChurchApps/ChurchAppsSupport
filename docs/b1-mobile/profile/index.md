# Profile

Your profile in B1 Mobile is where you manage your personal information, your household, and your privacy settings. Everything you update here is reflected across all ChurchApps services, so you only need to make changes in one place.

## Profile Tabs

The Profile screen is organized into several tabs:

### Profile

The **Profile** tab lets you view and edit your personal information, including your name, contact details, and profile photo. Keeping your profile up to date helps your church stay in touch with you.

### Household

The **Household** tab shows your family members and their roles within your household. This information is used for features like check-in, where you can check in your whole family at once.

### Visibility

The **Visibility** tab lets you control what other church members can see about you in the directory. You decide which personal details are shared and which stay private.

### Pending

The **Pending** tab shows any profile changes you have submitted that are waiting for admin approval.

### Account

The **Account** tab provides access to your security settings.

## Getting to Your Profile

1. Open the drawer menu.
2. Tap **Profile** to open your profile screen.
3. Use the tabs at the top to navigate between sections.
