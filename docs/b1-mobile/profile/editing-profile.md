# Editing Your Profile

<div class="article-intro">

The **Profile** tab lets you update your personal information so your church always has the right details on file. Changes you make here are reflected across all ChurchApps services, including B1.church and any other apps your church uses.

</div>

<div class="prereqs">
<h4>Before You Begin</h4>

- [Install B1 Mobile](../getting-started/installing) and [log in](../getting-started/logging-in) to your account

</div>

## What You Can Edit

Your profile includes the following personal details:

- **First name and last name** -- Your display name across ChurchApps
- **Email address** -- Used for church communications and account recovery
- **Phone number** -- So your church can reach you when needed
- **Address** -- Your home address for church records
- **Profile photo** -- The image that represents you in the [directory](../community/member-directory.md) and throughout the app

## Updating Your Information

1. Open the drawer menu and tap **Profile**.
2. Select the **Profile** tab if it is not already active.
3. Tap on the field you want to update and make your changes.
4. Save your changes when you are done.

Your updated information is synced automatically. Anyone who views your profile (subject to your [privacy settings](./privacy-settings)) will see the new details right away.

:::tip
Keep your email address and phone number current. Your church uses this information to send you important updates and reminders.

## Profile Photo

You can add or change your profile photo from the **Profile** tab. Your photo appears in the [member directory](../community/member-directory.md), group member lists, and anywhere else your profile is displayed.

## Changes Across ChurchApps

Because all ChurchApps services share the same account system, a change you make in B1 Mobile is immediately visible in [B1.church](../../b1-church/), your church's admin tools, and any other connected services. You do not need to update your information separately in each place.

:::info
Some churches require administrator approval for certain profile changes. If your update does not appear immediately, check the **Pending** tab on your profile screen for its status.
