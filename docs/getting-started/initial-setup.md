# Initial Setup

<div class="article-intro">

After creating your account and church, there are a few important steps to configure before inviting your team. This guide walks you through the recommended setup order so your church is ready to go from day one.

- Have your church logo and branding assets ready (optional but recommended)

</div>

## Step 1: Configure Your Church Information

1. Navigate to **Settings** in the left sidebar.
2. Click **Edit Settings**.
3. Enter your church's **name**, **address**, and **contact details**.
4. Click **Save** to apply your changes.

## Step 2: Set Up Your Branding

1. From the **Settings** page, upload your **church logo**.
2. Configure any additional branding options such as colors and images.
3. Your branding will appear on your B1.church website and in the B1 Mobile app.

Having your logo and branding ready before inviting team members gives a polished first impression when they log in.

## Step 3: Configure Roles and Invite Your Team

1. Click **Roles** from the **Settings** page.
2. Create roles for your team (for example, "Pastor", "Secretary", "Treasurer").
3. Assign the appropriate permissions to each role.
4. Add team members by searching for their accounts and assigning them to roles.

## Step 4: Set Up Your Key Areas

With your team in place, start building out the core areas of B1 Admin:

1. **People** -- Add members to your church directory. This is the foundation for everything else, so start here. You can add people manually or use the **Import** tool from **Settings**.
2. **Groups** -- Create groups for small groups, ministry teams, classes, and other gatherings.
3. **Attendance** -- Configure your campuses, services, and service times for tracking attendance.
4. **Donations** -- Set up donation funds and connect your payment gateway (Stripe) to accept online giving.
5. **Website** -- Build your public church website using the B1.church website builder.

You do not need to set up every area at once. Many churches start with **People** and **Groups**, then add **Attendance** and **Donations** as they get comfortable with the platform.

## Recommended Order

For the smoothest setup experience, we suggest this order:

1. **People** -- Add your members and regular attendees first.
2. **Groups** -- Organize people into meaningful groups.
3. **Attendance** -- Start tracking who shows up each week.
4. **Donations** -- Set up giving once your people are in the system.
5. **Website** -- Build your public-facing site last, after your data is in place.

Once you have completed these steps, your church is ready to go. Explore the [B1 Admin](/docs/b1-admin/) documentation for detailed guides on each area.
