![Rows 7](https://github.com/LiveChurchSolutions/ChurchAppsSupport/assets/127863068/25e4db29-6924-4862-8e42-d56ffa4c2353)
This will give you the number of rows you set. In this case three.
![Rows 8](https://github.com/LiveChurchSolutions/ChurchAppsSupport/assets/127863068/c659fc30-032b-4019-b9ec-a40980c6822d)
You can place any of the elements you would like in the rows. Each one is independent of the others.  For this example we will use the Text with Photo element.
![Rows 9](https://github.com/LiveChurchSolutions/ChurchAppsSupport/assets/127863068/51afb0a9-aef7-4264-893c-559d692c4ad1)
Drag the Text with Photo button into the Row you want to place it in.
![Text w:photo 1](https://github.com/LiveChurchSolutions/ChurchAppsSupport/assets/127863068/25214962-1ff4-4cfd-9384-f99897b68363)
It will open a dialog box to the right. First you'll need to choose a photo. You will have three choices to choose from. Gallery (these are photos you have previously uploaded), Upload (you can upload from your computer) and Stock Photos (these are copyright free photos you can use).

If you want to use a stock photo you can use one of the photos that shows up under stock photos or search our stock photo album for any photo you would like.
![Text w:photo 2:2](https://github.com/LiveChurchSolutions/ChurchAppsSupport/assets/127863068/d353773b-cfe3-4ada-8130-631e38416ae3)

Enter your text. You can customize it using the tools on top of the text box.
