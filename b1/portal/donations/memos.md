# Adding Memos to Your Donations

When making a donation through your church's B1 portal, you can include a memo to specify exactly what your gift is intended for. This feature allows you to designate your donation for specific purposes even when there isn't a dedicated fund set up for that purpose.

## Why Use Donation Memos?

Donation memos help you:
- **Specify your giving intentions** - Let the church know exactly how you'd like your gift to be used
- **Support special projects** - Contribute to specific initiatives, even without formal funds
- **Honor someone's memory** - Make memorial or tribute donations
- **Provide context** - Give additional details about your donation

## How to Add a Memo

1. **Access the donation page** - Visit your church's giving page (usually at `yourchurch.b1.church/donate`)

2. **Fill out donation details** - Enter your donation amount and select the appropriate fund

3. **Find the memo field** - Look for a text field labeled "Memo", "Note", or "Comments" in the donation form

4. **Enter your memo** - Type a clear, brief description of your donation's purpose

5. **Complete your donation** - Fill out the remaining payment information and submit

## Examples of Donation Memos

Here are some common examples of how members use donation memos:

- **Special Projects**: "Sound system upgrade", "New playground equipment", "Building fund"
- **Memorial Gifts**: "In memory of John Smith", "In loving memory of Mom"
- **Tribute Donations**: "In honor of Pastor Johnson's retirement"
- **Ministry Support**: "Youth mission trip to Guatemala", "Women's retreat scholarships"
- **Seasonal Giving**: "Christmas Eve service", "Easter decorations"
- **Personal Notes**: "Thank you for the wonderful service", "God bless the congregation"

## What Happens to Your Memo?

Your memo will:
- **Appear in church records** - Help staff track designated gifts and special intentions
- **Show in donation reports** - Be included in administrative reports for proper allocation
- **Guide fund allocation** - Assist leadership in directing your gift according to your wishes
- **Provide documentation** - Create a record of your giving intentions for both you and the church
