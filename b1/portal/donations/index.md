## Adding a Memo to Your Donation

When making a donation through your church's B1 portal, you can add a memo to specify the purpose of your gift. This is helpful when you want to designate your donation for something specific, even if there isn't a designated fund set up for it.

**To add a memo to your donation:**

1. **Navigate to your church's donation page** - This is typically found at `yourchurch.b1.church/donate` or through the "Give" button on your church's website.

2. **Fill out your donation details** - Enter the amount, select the fund, and fill in your payment information as usual.

3. **Look for the memo field** - You'll find a text field labeled "Memo" or "Note" below the fund selection area.

4. **Enter your memo** - Add a brief description of what your donation is for. For example:
   - "Youth mission trip"
   - "Sound system upgrade"
   - "In memory of John Smith"
   - "Special Christmas offering"

5. **Complete your donation** - Finish filling out the form and submit your donation as normal.

**Note:** Your memo will appear in the church's donation records and can help the administrative team properly allocate your gift according to your intentions.
