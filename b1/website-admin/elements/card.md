   Make sure you have a section placed on your page.

   Set the design of your section and click save.

3. ![Card 1](https://github.com/LiveChurchSolutions/ChurchAppsSupport/assets/127863068/3ef95272-bc79-441b-aa89-441548ca6497)
   The Card element makes a nice graphic/text card on your page. To demonstrate it we'll first set up three rows on the page. The Card element will work on a full page but you can see the card effect better when there are three equal rows.
   Choose the Row element.

4. ![Card 2](https://github.com/LiveChurchSolutions/ChurchAppsSupport/assets/127863068/77bdca6c-5a49-43f8-9b6a-92fc4c094849)
   Drag it to the section.

5. ![Card 3](https://github.com/LiveChurchSolutions/ChurchAppsSupport/assets/127863068/74d100d6-e0da-4ff2-ab3a-99b2917adc11)
   Choose thirds from the common options.

6. ![Card 4](https://github.com/LiveChurchSolutions/ChurchAppsSupport/assets/127863068/9fff27cb-b2a1-4d31-8945-614d297bada8)

   You now have three equal areas to work with. Drag and drop the Card element in the first row.

7. ![Card 6](https://github.com/LiveChurchSolutions/ChurchAppsSupport/assets/127863068/a4a62b37-a8e0-4d57-9935-5c8e90a78152)
   Select a photo.

   You can also choose your aspect ratio. (I recommend using the same one or free form when doing 3 equal cards)
