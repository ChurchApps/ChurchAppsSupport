**Using White Space in your Website**

White space is a great way to add blank space to your web page. You can adjust it to whatever size you would like it to be. It will spread out your elements so more of your background will show. (Especially useful if you are using a video or photo background).

Make sure you have a section placed on your page.

Set the design of your section and click save.

It is transparent so you won't see it on your actual web page. The red box is added here to show approx. where the white space is.
