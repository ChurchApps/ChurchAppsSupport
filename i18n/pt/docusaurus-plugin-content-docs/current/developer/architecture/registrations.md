# Event Registrations

<div class="article-intro">

Native event registration lives in the content module and, since the paid-registrations wave, carries a full commerce model: priced attendee types, priced add-on selections, discount codes, payments through the church's existing giving gateway, and a status-driven waitlist. The money path deliberately reuses the giving stack — the registration controller charges through the same `GatewayService` / `IGatewayProvider` abstraction documented in [Giving](./giving), so no card data or gateway SDK knowledge lives in the content module. This page maps the data model, the pricing and capacity rules, and the registration, payment, and waitlist flows.

Three rules hold across the stack:

1. **The server owns the price.** Clients submit type ids, selection ids, and quantities; `RegistrationPricingHelper.computeTotal()` computes the total server-side and coupons are re-validated at charge time. A client-supplied amount is never trusted.
2. **Capacity is enforced atomically at insert time.** Every capacity-limited insert uses an `INSERT … SELECT … FROM dual WHERE (count of active rows) < capacity` statement, so two simultaneous registrations can't both take the last spot. Counts are derived from status (`pending`/`confirmed`), never stored.
3. **Payments ride the giving rails.** `RegistrationController` calls the shared `GatewayService.processCharge` with the church's configured gateway — the same provider abstraction, tokenization model, and SCA handling as donations.

## Data model (`Api/src/modules/content`)

Models are in `models/Registration.ts`; table mappings in `db/DatabaseTypes.ts`; one repo per table under `repositories/`.

| Table | Meaning | Key fields |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| `registrations` | One registration (one household/party for one event) | eventId, personId, householdId, **status** (`pending` / `confirmed` / `waitlisted` / `cancelled`), totalAmount, amountPaid, couponId, waitlistNotifiedDate, registeredDate, cancelledDate |
| `registrationMembers` | One attendee on a registration | registrationId, personId, firstName, lastName, **registrationTypeId** |
| `registrationTypes` | Attendee types per event (e.g. Adult / Child) | eventId, name, description, **price**, **capacity**, minAgeYears, maxAgeYears, formId, sort, active |
| `registrationSelections` | Named add-on options with a price (e.g. T-shirt) | eventId, name, description, **price**, **capacity**, **maxQuantity** (per-registration cap), sort, active |
| `registrationSelectionChoices` | Quantity of a selection chosen by a registration/member | registrationId, registrationMemberId, selectionId, **quantity** |
| `registrationPayments` | One successful charge against a registration | registrationId, gatewayId, provider, transactionId, method, amount, currency, kind (`charge`), status (`succeeded`), personId |
| `registrationCoupons` | Discount codes per event | eventId, code, **discountType** (`percent` / `amount`), **value**, startDate, endDate, **minMembers**, **maxUses**, active |

Notes:

- **There is no waitlist table.** Waitlisted parties are `registrations` rows with `status = 'waitlisted'`; the whole waitlist lifecycle is status transitions on that one table.
- **No stored counters.** "Sold" / "used" counts (event capacity, per-type capacity, per-selection capacity, coupon uses) are computed with correlated subqueries over rows whose status is in `('pending','confirmed')` (`RegistrationTypeRepo.loadActiveWithUsage`, `RegistrationRepo.countActiveForEvent` / `countActiveForCoupon`). Cancelling a registration therefore frees capacity with no bookkeeping.
- Prices are MySQL DECIMAL columns (strings over the wire) coerced with `Number()` inside the pricing helper.

## REST surface

Everything is under `/content/registrations` (`controllers/RegistrationController.ts`), gated by `Permissions.registrations` (`view` / `edit`):

| Route | Access | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| `POST /register` | anonymous | Full submission: guest or member, server pricing, capacity checks, optional charge |
| `GET /types/event/:eventId`, `GET /selections/event/:eventId` | public | Types/selections with derived `used` / `remainingCapacity` for the wizard |
| `POST /types`, `DELETE /types/:id` (same for `/selections`, `/coupons`) | `registrations.edit` | Staff settings CRUD |
| `POST /coupons/validate` | public | Inline discount-code validation during the wizard |
| `GET /coupons/event/:eventId` | staff | Coupons with uses counts |
| `GET /event/:eventId` · `GET /event/:eventId/count` | staff · public | Roster; active-count for capacity display |
| `GET /person/:personId` · `GET /:id` · `GET /payments/:registrationId` | authed | My Registrations, detail, payment history |
| `PUT /:id` | owner/staff | Post-submission edit — replaces members and selection choices with fresh atomic capacity checks, recomputes `totalAmount`; never auto-charges or refunds |
| `POST /:id/pay` | owner | "Complete payment": charges `totalAmount − amountPaid`, flips `waitlisted`/`pending` → `confirmed` |
| `POST /:id/promote` | staff | Manual waitlist promotion |
| `POST /:id/cancel` · `DELETE /:id` | owner · staff | Cancel / delete; both trigger waitlist auto-promotion |

A non-cancelled existing registration for the same `personId` on the same event is rejected with a 409, and each created registration emits a `registration.created` webhook via `WebhookDispatcher`.

## Pricing and discount codes

`helpers/RegistrationPricingHelper.ts` is the single money-math authority:

- `computeTotal()` sums each member's type price plus each selection choice's `price × quantity`.
- `validateCoupon()` enforces active flag, date window (`startDate`/`endDate`), `minMembers` against the submitted party size, and `maxUses` against the status-derived redemption count.
- `applyDiscount()` — `percent` subtracts `total × value/100`; `amount` subtracts `value`; both floor at zero.

The wizard calls `POST /coupons/validate` for inline feedback, but `register` re-validates and re-applies the coupon server-side — the client's displayed total is advisory only.

## The atomic capacity idiom

Every capacity-limited insert races safely without transactions or locks by making the capacity check part of the `INSERT` itself. Event-level (`RegistrationRepo.atomicInsertWithCapacityCheck`):

```sql
INSERT INTO registrations (id, churchId, eventId, ...)
  SELECT ?, ?, ?, ...
  FROM dual
  WHERE (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM registrations
         WHERE eventId=? AND churchId=? AND status IN ('pending','confirmed')) < ?
```

Zero affected rows means "at capacity". The same idiom guards per-type inserts (`RegistrationMemberRepo.atomicInsertWithTypeCapacity`, counting members joined to active registrations) and per-selection quantities (`RegistrationSelectionChoiceRepo.atomicInsertWithCapacityCheck`, using `COALESCE(SUM(quantity),0) + ? <= capacity`). When any member or selection insert fails mid-registration, the controller rolls the partial registration back with `deleteCascade()` and reports which type or selection sold out.

## Payment flow

`processRegistrationCharge` in the controller is the only place registrations touch money, and it is a thin client of the giving stack:

```
RegistrationController ─▶ RepoManager.getRepos("giving").gateway
                       ─▶ GatewayService.getGatewayForChurch(churchId, …)
                       ─▶ GatewayService.processCharge(gateway, chargeData)
                             └▶ IGatewayProvider.processCharge  (Stripe / PayPal / Kingdom Funding)
```

Tokenization happens in the browser exactly as for donations (see [Giving](./giving)) — the wizard reuses the apphelper payment provider registry, so logged-in members can pay with saved cards and guests tokenize a new card. The controller mirrors `DonateController`'s provider quirks (Kingdom Funding `pm-{id}` payment-method ids, Stripe SCA `requires_action` responses returned to the client without recording a payment). A successful charge writes a `registrationPayments` row, bumps `amountPaid`, and confirms the registration. **Refunds are not implemented** — a cancelled paid registration keeps its payment rows and any refund is handled out-of-band in the gateway dashboard.

Both entry points route through the same code path: `register` (pay at signup) and `pay` (balance payment / waitlist completion).

## Waitlist lifecycle

When the event is full and the event's `waitlistEnabled` flag is on, `register` saves the party as `waitlisted` (skipping capacity checks) and sends the normal confirmation email marked as a waitlist spot. Promotion happens three ways — `cancel`, `delete`, and the staff `promote` endpoint — all funneling into `RegistrationRepo.promoteFromWaitlist`, which picks the oldest waitlisted row and flips it atomically:

```sql
UPDATE registrations SET status='pending', waitlistNotifiedDate=NOW()
  WHERE id=? AND status='waitlisted'
    AND (…active count for the event…) < ?
```

The `status='waitlisted'` guard means concurrent promotions can't double-promote a row, and the capacity subquery means a promotion can't oversell. Promoted rows land on `pending` — not `confirmed` — because a balance may still be owed; `RegistrationHelper.sendWaitlistAvailabilityEmail` tells the registrant their spot opened and, when `totalAmount − amountPaid > 0`, links to the complete-payment page. Paying (or having no balance) confirms them.

:::info
A capacity raise does not auto-promote by itself — staff use the roster's Promote action after raising capacity. Cancels and deletes promote automatically.

## Client surfaces

- **B1App wizard** — one shared hook, `B1App/src/components/registration/useEventRegistration.ts`, drives both the website component (`components/registration/EventRegister.tsx`) and the mobile portal screen (`app/[sdSlug]/mobile/components/screens/EventRegisterPage.tsx`) through the steps `info → members → selections → questions → payment → confirm` (the middle steps render only when the event has selections, an attached form, or a nonzero total). The info/members steps show per-attendee-type pickers with live remaining-capacity and sold-out states; payment (`RegistrationPaymentForm.tsx`) shows the order summary, discount-code entry, and — for logged-in members — saved payment methods via the apphelper provider registry, with guests tokenizing a new card. The **Registrations** mobile screen (`screens/RegistrationsPage.tsx`) is My Registrations: status, balance due, Complete payment (`POST /:id/pay`), Edit (`PUT /:id` — contact, member types, selection quantities), and Cancel.
- **B1Admin settings** — `B1Admin/src/registrations/components/RegistrationSettingsEdit.tsx` adds the Enable Waitlist switch plus accordions for Attendee Types, Selections, and Discount Codes (`RegistrationTypesEdit.tsx` / `RegistrationSelectionsEdit.tsx` / `RegistrationCouponsEdit.tsx`), all CRUD against the `/types`, `/selections`, `/coupons` routes.
- **B1Admin roster** — `B1Admin/src/registrations/RegistrationDetailsPage.tsx`: per-attendee Type column, Paid/Total column with balance chip, per-type count chips, a payments detail dialog (`RegistrationDetailDialog.tsx`, from `GET /payments/:registrationId`), the waitlist Promote row action, and CSV export including attendee types, selections, paid/total/balance, and question answers.

Cross-module lookups (resolving or creating the guest person, loading the church for emails) go through `getMembershipModuleGateway()` — the content module never reads membership tables directly.
