When you create an account on any LCS website, you can log in using the same information across all ChurchApps. Resetting your password is the same process across all platforms.

1. In the Please sign in box in the bottom right-hand corner, click on the Forgot Password link
2. It will open a new box titled Reset Password. Enter the email address you used to set up your account and click on the Reset Button.
3. Your screen will display a message stating your password reset email has been sent to your email address.
4. Open your email and click on the link within the body of the password reset email to reset your password. Note: The link will only work once, so be sure to reset your password the first time you click.
5. Select a Church from the list, and you will be redirected to the Edit Profile Page
6. Input a password in the Set Password field, Verify Password, and select Save.

Itâ€™s that easy. Your password is now reset!
