When you create an account on any LCS website, you can log in using the same information across all ChurchApps. Changing your password is the same process across all platforms.

1. Click on your account name in the top right corner of the page and select profile
2. It will open a new Edit Profile window.
3. Enter your new password and verify it, then click save.
4. Log out and log back in with your new password.

Itâ€™s that easy. Your password has been changed. If you have forgotten your password and need to reset it instead. See the [How to Reset Your Password](reset-passwords.md)
