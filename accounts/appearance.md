Church appearance settings apply to all apps, but are used the most heavily by StreamingLive.  To change your appearance on StreamingLive:

1. Click on your account name in the top right corner of the page and select admin dashboard
2. It will open a page full of admin settings.
3. Customize Appearance in the External Resources box.
4. CLick on the pencil icon in the top right corner of the Church Appearance box.
5. Click on "none" in the light logo section to upload a logo.  This logo should have a transparent background and use darker colors designed to be shown on a lighter background.
5. Do the same for the dark background variant of your logo, which should use lighter colors.
6. Click on the color boxes to set your color scheme.  Both the primary and background colors also require a contrast color which is the color text appears on those backgrounds.
10. Click save.

Your StreamingLive page will now utilize your color scheme and logo.  All other ChurchApps you configure will also use the provided logos for consistent branding.
