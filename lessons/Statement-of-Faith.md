**STATEMENT OF FAITH**

Although we acknowledge that no man-made statement can encapsulate the full Biblical understanding of our faith. We submit this statement to make clear the core beliefs of Church Apps as an organization.

**GOD:** There is one, holy God who eternally exists in three persons – Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. God created all things visible and invisible. God is perfect in wisdom, power, and love, knowing all things past, present, and future, and his sovereign plan of redemption was set in place before the foundation of the world. (Gen 1:1-2, Dt. 6:4, Heb 11:3, Eph 1:9-10; Rev 13:8)

**JESUS:** Jesus Christ is God’s only begotten Son, born of a virgin, fully divine and fully human, and our Savior and Lord. Jesus, who was without sin, died in our place as a substitutionary sacrifice for our sins, bearing divine wrath, and reconciling to God all who trust in him. Jesus was bodily resurrected in victory over sin and death. He ascended to the right hand of the Father where he presently reigns as our king, high priest, and advocate until his glorious return. (John 3:16, Col 1:15; 2:9-15; 1 Cor 15:3-8, 20-28; 2 Cor 5:18-21; Heb 4:14-15)

**HOLY SPIRIT:** is fully divine and active in the church and the world. The Holy Spirit draws all people to Christ by illuminating the gospel and convicting of sin. The Holy Spirit dwells in the life of a believer to transform, guide, assure, and empower living a fruitful Christian life. (John 16:8-11; Acts 2:38; 2 Cor 3:17-18; Gal 3:2)

**BIBLE:** God is revealed in the Bible, the uniquely inspired written Word of God and infallible in all that it affirms. The Bible is the final authority in all matters of faith and practice. (2 Tim 3:16; 2 Pet 1:20-21)

**HUMANITY:** God creates all humans, male and female, in his image, and therefore all people have intrinsic value and purpose. By the sin of the first man and woman (Adam and Eve), death entered the world. All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, alienated from God and without hope apart from the blood of Jesus Christ. (Gen 1:26-27; Gen 3; Rom 3:23; Eph 2:1-3)

**SALVATION:** Salvation can be found in Christ alone and is offered to all by grace through faith. A living faith is demonstrated through repentance, confession, baptism by immersion, and a life of obedience. (Rom 3:23; 5:12, Acts 2:38, Gal 3:26-29; Eph 2:4-10)

**CHURCH:** The church is the body of Christ on earth, with Christ as the head. God’s church is comprised of a priesthood of all believers, serving as minister of the gospel according to the gifts which God has given them. Together the church is called to make disciples of all nations until Christ returns. (Matt 28:18-20; Eph 3:10; 4:11-13; Col 1:18; 1 Pet 2:9-10) 

**RETURN OF CHRIST:** Christ will visibly return to restore creation and judge the world. There will be a bodily resurrection for the believers to eternal life with God in heaven and for the unbelievers to eternal judgment in hell. In heaven, sin will be no more and those in Christ will live in fellowship with God forever. (Acts 1:11; 2 Thess 1:5-12; 1 Thess 4:13-18; Rev 20:11-15)
