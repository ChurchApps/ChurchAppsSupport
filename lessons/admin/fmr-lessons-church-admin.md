## Quick Links

- [Lessons.Church Login](https://lessons.church/login)

The 3 types of files you have to choose from are as follows.

## 1. Add Variant (for download/player)

Used for most applications.

## 2. Add Asset (for player only)

This would be used only if you want a file to use that only plays on the lessons.church app. An example would be, if you uploaded a zip file as a Variant so users can download all the slides you have but you are wanting to use those assets so when someone is using the lessons.church app, they can access those files.

## 3. Bulk Add Asset

Extra Helpful notes:

- Each lesson is associated with each of the sermons in the series.
- Remember to click save at the end of each study/lesson/section creation.
- It is suggested to create the file structure prior to building the venues.
- Add PPT files as varaints in bundle so that they can be downloaded.
- For a more in-depth look into how to build a file structure please see the file structure best practices video.
