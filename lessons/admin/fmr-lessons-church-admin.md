41. The 3 types of files you have to choose from are as follows.

## 1. Add Variant (for download/player)

Used for most applications.

## 2. Add Asset (for player only)

This would be used only if you want a file to use that only plays on the lessons.church app. An example would be, if you uploaded a zip file as a Variant so users can download all the slides you have but you are wanting to use those assets so when someone is using the lessons.church app, they can access those files.

## 3. Bulk Add Asset

Very useful for uploading all the slides for a Lesson at one time. Remember when you do this, make sure to make a .zip and upload it as a varaint in the same folder. So any user that wants to can download all the slides and use them outside of the lessons.church app.
For this application, we will choose the Varaint option because we will be adding a countdown for the lessons.church app but we also want to allow users to easily download this file.

52. There are 5 different Action Types. It is important to think about how the user is using the content when you set an action.

### 1. Say: This is the action you use when you want the presenter to say something to the crowd they are talking to.

### 2. Do: This action is setup for the leader to read and do. An example would be for dramatic effect (Walk off the Stage)

### 3. Play: This action is used to play a slide or video on the lessons.church app

### 4. Download this action is used to indicate to the user to download something to print and give out like a parent guide.

### 5. Note is just a note to give the instructor.

Select the correct action and then put in the appropiate material.

### Writing the Large Group venue

- Use the sermon scripts in Dropbox to upload large group (sermon) content.

### Dropbox path: Dropbox >> FMR >> Resources >> Sermon Series >> Name of Sermon

- Follow the sermon script to categorize the content.
- Example categories: preparation, illustration, tension/transition, Bible study, application, and landing (Note: each category should be in all caps.)
- Fill in each category using the sermon script (easiest to copy and paste)

### Writing the Small Group venue

-Use the sermon scripts in Dropbox to upload large group (sermon) content.

### DropBox path: DropBox >> FMR >> Resources >> Sermon Series >> Name of Sermon

- Create “Small Group Discussion” and “Reading Plan” categories (ensure both are all caps).
- Click the + sections button.
- Add categories.
- Specify the role. (The role for each category is leader, except for the reading plan category. The role for the reading plan category is student.)
- Small Group Discussion should have a do action (telling to ask the questions) and a say action (copy and paste the questions).
- The Reading Plan only requires a do action.

53. Finsh and Check to make sure everything is working correctly once you have completeed the lesson. Make sure to go back and mark the Lesson as live and the Study as live then head over to [Lessons.Church](https://lessons.church/login) to make sure everything is working correctly. Test the downloads and go through the text layout.
