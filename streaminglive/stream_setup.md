## Setting up your recurring service live stream
The idea behind this is to set up your live stream that repeats every week we recommend using youtube. Why because it is free and it is the easiest to view on most devices.
You will need to set up a YouTube account and remember to test streaming from the YouTube page. YouTube makes you wait 24 hours before your first stream so try to start one and it will start that countdown.

Login to B1.Church and click on the settings icon
