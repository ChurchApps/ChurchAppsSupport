# How to Add a Playlist

A playlist is any group of sermons, but usually represents a sermon series.  You could also create playlists for elder meetings, funerals, weddings, or anything else you wish to stream.  Each sermon is assigned to a single playlist.  To add a playlist.

1. Click the Add icon in the top right corner of the playlists section.
2. Enter any title and description you would like for the playlist.
3. Enter a publish date.  This simply keeps your playlists in chronological order and does not actually schedule it to play at a specified date.  All scheduling is handled via Services.
4. If you choose you can upload a photo for the series.  This is image is not currently used but will be with a future update.
5. Click the Save button.

You can now assign sermons to this playlist by editing the sermon.
