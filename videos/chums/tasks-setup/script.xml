    Tasks are a great way to assign jobs within your organization. Start by clicking on the Tasks icon on the Chums homepage.
    <break time="1s"/>
    <mark name="2" />
    Click the plus symbol to add a new task.
    <break time="1s"/>
    <mark name="3" />
    First, associate the task with someone in your church who is assigning it.
    <break time="1s"/>
    <mark name="4" />
    You can select either a person or a group as the assigner.
    <break time="1s"/>
    <mark name="5" />
    Next, assign the task to someone who will be completing it.
    <break time="1s"/>
    <mark name="6" />
    Again, you can choose either a person or a group as the assignee.
    <break time="1s"/>
    <mark name="7" />
    Give the task a title describing what needs to be accomplished. You may add an optional note, then click Save.
    <break time="1s"/>
    <mark name="8" />
    The task will appear in your task list when you click the task icon. To mark a task as complete, click on the task name and select "closed".
    <break time="2s"/>
    <mark name="end" />
