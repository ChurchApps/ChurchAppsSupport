    Let's import your data from Excel or CSV into Chums. First, make sure your Excel or CSV file is on your desktop.
    <break time="1s"/>
    <mark name="2"/>
    In Chums, go to Settings and then to Import/Export.
    <break time="1s"/>
    <mark name="3"/>
    Choose Chums Import Zip from the options.
    <break time="1s"/>
    <mark name="4"/>
    Download the sample file to see the required format.
    <break time="1s"/>
    <mark name="5"/>
    Unzip the sample file and open people.csv. Replace the data in this file with your data, but don't change the top row. Save your edited file as people.csv.
    <break time="1s"/>

    Now, create a zip file with your data. On a Mac, highlight the files and drag them to your desktop, then right-click and choose Compress. On a PC, right-click the folder, select Send to, and choose Compressed folder. Save the zip file on your desktop.

    Go back to Chums and click the upload icon. Upload the zip file you just created. Once uploaded, you'll see your data. Scroll to the bottom and click Continue.
    <break time="1s"/>

    Let the process run until you see a completion screen. Click "Go to Chums" to return to the main application.
