    Layers are essential in any good presentation software. In this guide, we'll explore how to use layers and overlays to create the most effective presentations for your needs.

    Let's begin with overlays. To access your different overlay options, click on the Overlays tab.
    <break time="1s"/>
    <mark name="3" />
    To activate an overlay on your current screen, simply click on the overlay you want to use. It will immediately appear on your output screen.
    <break time="1s"/>

    There are two ways to remove an overlay from the output screen: you can either click "Clear All" to remove everything, or click the X on the specific overlay slide you want to remove.

    To modify an existing overlay, right-click on it and select "Edit" from the menu.

    After making your desired changes, click "Show" to return to the main view.

    If you want an overlay to appear throughout an entire show, drag it to the first slide of that show. This will automatically apply it to every slide in the presentation.

    To remove an overlay from a show, click the overlay icon in the top right corner of the slide. Note that if the show is currently live, you'll also need to remove it from the output window.

    Remember that all layers work the same way, so these concepts apply to any type of media you're working with.
