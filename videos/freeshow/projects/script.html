    Projects are organized using both folders and project files. You can create folders within folders, and store your project files inside them to maintain a clean structure.

    To navigate through your folders, simply click on any folder's row to expand or collapse it.

    As your presentation library grows, staying organized becomes essential. Using folders effectively will help you maintain a clean and efficient workspace.

    To create a new folder or project, right-click anywhere in the projects pane and select either "New Folder" or "New Project" from the menu.

    You can also create new folders or projects by using the buttons located at the bottom of the Project window.

    By default, new projects are automatically named with today's date in the format: day, month, and year.

    To customize how project names are generated, open the Settings menu.
    <break time="1s"/>
    <mark name="9" />
    Navigate to the General tab, where you'll find the "Default Project Name" option. This allows you to modify how automatic naming works.
    <break time="1s"/>
    <mark name="10" />
    For example, if you prefer to have the month appear first in the date, you can adjust the format here.
    <break time="1s"/>
    <mark name="11" />
    After making your changes, click the Show button to return to the projects window.
    <break time="1s"/>
    <mark name="12" />
    Now when you create a new project, it will follow your preferred date format.
    <break time="1s"/>

    Remember, projects are designed to contain one meeting's worth of content, helping you keep each presentation separate and organized.
