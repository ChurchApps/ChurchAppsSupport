    Configuring domains for your site takes place in Chums.  You can go to chums.org and login
    <mark name="2" />
    or if you're on B1, click the profile drop down and choose switch app.
    <break time="1s"/>
    <mark name="3" />
    In Chums, choose the settings menu on the left.
    <break time="1s"/>
    <mark name="4" />
    And click the edit settings icon.
    If you are missing these options, it's because you lack permissions.
    Request the person who set up your church grant you access to "Edit Church Settings"
    <break time="1s"/>

    Every church that uses B1 has a subdomain assigned to them.  In our case, we have chosen "ironwood" as the subdomain for our test church of Ironwood Church.
    This means we can go to ironwood.b1.church to get to our B1 content.
    <break time="1s"/>
    <mark name="6" />
    Set this subdomain to whatever you would like.  It needs to have no spaces and be unique.
    <mark name="7" />
    In addition to the subdomain, you can set up your own custom domains to point to your B1 site.
    For example, the site ChurchApps.org is hosted with B1.
    <break time="1s"/>
    <mark name="8" />
    To configure this, you will need to log into your DNS provider such as GoDaddy, CloudFlare, or in our case A.W.S.
    <break time="1s"/>
    <mark name="9" />
    There are two records you will need to add.  An A record for your root domain of 3.23.251.61.
    <break time="1s"/>
    <mark name="10" />
    And a CNAME record for your www subdomain pointing to proxy.b1.church.
    <break time="1s"/>
    <mark name="11" />
    Once these have been added, return to Chums and add your domain to the list of custom domains and click Add and Save.
    After a few minutes your B1 site will be accessible from your custom domain.
    <break time="2s"/>
