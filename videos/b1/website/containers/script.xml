    Box is another container element.
    <break time="1s"/>
    <mark name="2" />
    It behaves like a section, but spans a content area rather than the whole width of the screen.
    <break time="1s"/>
    <mark name="3" />
    Configure it and hit save... and you'll have an empty, styled, box on your page.
    <break time="1s"/>
    <mark name="4" />
    Drag and drop elements into the box and they will take on that styling.
    <break time="1.5s"/>
    <mark name="5" />
    Carousel is another container element.
    <break time="1s"/>
    <mark name="6" />
    Set the height, the number of slides and whether you want it to auto-play and hit save.
    <break time="1s"/>
    <mark name="7" />
    It will give you an empty carousel with three slides.
    <break time="1s"/>
    <mark name="8" />
    Add a component to the first slide.
    <break time="1s"/>
    <mark name="9" />
    Click the right arrow to add an element to the next slide.
    <break time="1s"/>
    <mark name="10" />
    Continue until all the slides are full.  It will auto-rotate between these when a visitor loads the page.
    <break time="1.5s"/>
    <mark name="11" />
    The expandable element allows you to add collapsible accordions containing information.
    <break time="1s"/>
    <mark name="12" />
    They're great for FAQs or other content that you want to hide until a visitor clicks on it.
    <break time="1s"/>
    <mark name="13" />
    Add several in sequence and they will appear as a list of topics.
    <break time="1s"/>
    <mark name="14" />
    Click to expand or collapse any topic.
    <break time="2s"/>
    <mark name="end" />
