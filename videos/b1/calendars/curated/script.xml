    Once groups have added events to their calendars, an admin can create curated calendars, which contain events from multiple groups.
    <break time="1s"/>
    <mark name="2" />
    To add a new one, go to the calendars section of the B1 admin and click the "Add" icon.
    <break time="1s"/>
    <mark name="3" />
    Give it a name and click "Save".
    <break time="1s"/>
    <mark name="4" />
    Next Click on the "Manage Events" icon to select what appears on the calendar.
    <break time="1s"/>
    <mark name="5" />
    The actual events are added from the group pages, not the curated calendar.  Here are you selecting which of those existing events to include.  Click "Add" to begin.
    <break time="1s"/>
    <mark name="6" />
    Select a Group to include that groups events on this calendar and click "Save".
    <break time="1s"/>
    <mark name="7" />
    Those events will show up on the curated calendar.  As new events are added to the group, they will automatically be included.
    <break time="2s"/>
