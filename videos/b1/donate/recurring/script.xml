    The recurring donations work the same as one time with two differences.
    <break time="1s"/>
    The first is the donation cannot be anonymous.  You must enter your name and email address so that you can later edit or cancel the donation.
    <break time="1s"/>
    <mark name="2" />
    The second is that you need to choose the frequency of the donation and choose the start date for the first donation.
    <break time="1s"/>
    <mark name="3" />
    Submit the form as before.
    <break time="1s"/>
    <mark name="4" />
    This time you will receive a confirmation email with a link to edit your donations.
    <break time="2s"/>
    <mark name="end" />
