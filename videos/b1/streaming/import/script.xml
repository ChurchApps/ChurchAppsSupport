    To import your existing videos, you can use the bulk import from YouTube or Vimeo option in the Settings sidebar.  They both work the same way.
    <break time="1s"/>
    <mark name="2" />
    Before you can do so, you must first create a playlist for the videos to be added to.
    <break time="1s"/>
    <mark name="3" />
    If you wish you can create a single "sermons" playlist to contain all videos.  In our case, we're going to make one for our Exodus sermon series.
    Give it a name, description and a 16 by 9 photo.  Set a start date for the series so they appear in order and click save.
    <break time="1s"/>
    <mark name="4" />
    We're now ready to run the bulk import.  Click the link for Youtube or Vimeo.
    <break time="1s"/>
    <mark name="5" />
    You will need to enter your channel I.D. to fetch videos.  See the help link on this page for instructions on how to find it.
    <break time="1s"/>
    <mark name="6" />
    Click fetch and you will see a list of videos from your YouTube channel.
    <break time="1s"/>
    <mark name="7" />
    Select your Playlist and check the videos you wish to be a part of it and click Save.
    If you wish you can check the box for new videos uploaded to automatically be added in the future.
    <break time="1s"/>
    <mark name="8" />
    Those videos will be imported along with all their details such as date, run time, descriptions and thumbnails.
    <break time="1s"/>
    <mark name="9" />
    You can repeat the process with additional sermon series.
    <break time="1s"/>
    <mark name="10" />
    These sermon series
    <break time="0.5s"/>
    <mark name="11" />
    And their related videos will show up on the sermons page you create with the website builder.
    <break time="2s"/>
