    Give your service a name and set the next start time.  In most cases you'll want to set it as recurring weekly, unless this is a special one-time service.
    If you want to open the chat a little bit before service starts or leaving it running a little bit after service ends, enter the number of minutes you would like for each.

    Often churches will want to start the video stream a few minutes before the scheduled time and show a countdown or slides.  Enter how early if so.
    <break time="1s"/>

    Finally, select which sermon video you would like to play.  "Latest Sermon" plays your most recently added video.  You can set this once and never change it.
    In another video we'll cover setting up a url to your live feed, which will enable the Live Feed option here.
