    B1 is the platform for communicating with members and visitors of your church.
    It is broken into two main parts:

    <mark name="2" />
    A website builder where you can create your primary church website or supplemental web content.

    <mark name="3" />
    And the member portal that provides various ways for users to interact with your church.
    <break time="1s"/>
    <mark name="4" />
    This member portal is also available as a mobile app, the B1.church app.

    As an admin, you can configure which tabs appear in the mobile app from the Mobile App Settings page.

    Some tabs show up automatically when conditions are met.  Others can be manually added by clicking the Add Tab button.
