    Let's export your data from Breeze and import it into B1.church Admin. You'll need three files for this process: People, Tags, and Contributions. Don't skip any of these files - you need all three to complete the process.

    To get these files, go to your Breeze account dashboard, then to 'settings' and 'manage accounts'. Export each file as an .xlsx file separately.
    <break time="1s"/>
    <mark name="3"/>
    Now, let's create a zip file with these three files. On a Mac, highlight the three files, right-click or control-click, and choose Compress. This will create a file named Archive. Save it somewhere on your computer where you can find it easily.

    On a PC, right-click the three files, select Send to, and then choose Compressed (zipped) folder. A new zipped folder will be created in the same location.

    Next, go to B1.church Admin.org and log in. Navigate to Settings, then Import/Export under tools.

    Upload the Breeze import zip file you created. Once uploaded, you'll see your data. Scroll to the bottom and click continue.
    <break time="1s"/>

    At the bottom of the page, click confirm to import the file into the B1.church Admin database.
    <break time="1s"/>

    Let the process run until you see the completion screen. Click "Go to B1.church Admin" to return to the main application.
